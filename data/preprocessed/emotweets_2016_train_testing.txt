Arsenal may have made a slow start to the Premier League season, but Arsene Wenger's men are clearly looking to pick up the pace.

Last day of being 30 today. Although some Arsenal fans would have had me at 31 the day after my 30th birthday...
Own goal is in unreal Form. Scoring goals for fun. Just hope he comes back injury free. England and Arsenal's 12th man.
Padres have "3rd team cam." Naturally, there's a dude in an Arsenal kit. I don't think you can even have a block party w/o an Arsenal shirt.

@JCuzzy1 @Fydsy @FootyML @JimFish286 @Wolf_TicketsLFC our true par is probably 5th behind Arsenal. It might not be nice but it's the reality
An Amazon delivery on a Sunday is as unpredictable as Arsenal on transfer deadline day.
I guess having 3 main teams is the best way to go about it, going with Arsenal,PSG, and a 3rd one I can't  think of atm
@goonersteve12 . So long as Arsenal finish 4th, CL is confirmed, Mr Wenger will remain as manager. Realistically, we can not win the PL.
@JHickin it doesn't matter where they play, what matters is they play for Wales, better than England, may I add! (P.s, Ramsey is Arsenal)
Excellent performance tonight from @MCWFC looking to see you against Arsenal next Sunday
Take Welbeck being unable for the Euros with a pinch of salt. Pretty sure we'll see him in an Arsenal shirt come May.
Arsene Wenger admits Arsenal must be "more realistic" about their Premier League title chances after losing 2-1 at Swansea City on Sunday.

@NariahCFC against barca pre season stand out player 1st half.. I dunno what's going on with us atm frustrating to see us lose
Neymar playing his last game for Barca before he signs for us on Tuesday I see #PigsMightFly
We now just need less than 4.5 goals in the Barca match and Real match to land the 32/1 7-fold. I may cover our bet before the last match
@fcbarcelona surprise, surprise! Barca has the upperhand, but it seems Malaga has their 12th man, the ref is so bias. #CampNou #FCBMalaga
I honestly think what we're seeing with Fabregas is really him and why Barca were quick to part ways. Last August-November was a one-off
I can't believe the last time Barca scored against Malaga was in January 2014, that's odd. My money on Malaga to win tonight #bbceurofooty
Again, awful from Barca. Not the best result, they should get 3 goals or more. Calderon on the 12th, serious.
Vermaelen the hero for Barca: Thomas Vermaelen was the unlikely hero as Barcelona laboured to a 1-0 home win over Malaga on Saturday ...
@ChampionsLeague @realmadriden @FCBarcelona @LigaBBVA Barca may have more points but Real Madrid play the better football
#Barca Did Florentino Perez make the schedule in La Liga? Barca's 1st 4 away games all against top 8 teams; RM plays Sevilla &amp; 3 creampuffs.
@jodynotjodie Same. Knackered. I'm going into town tomorrow to watch it. Probably go Barca on the locks. Where you watching it?!
Barca on the other hand could have problems. Must avoid injuries and stay in touch til Jan and probably add 2 more on top of Arda an Vidal
@BenUFO hey ben really enjoyed your set in barca last night, what was the 2nd last track you played? sounded like caribou?
had great time in Barca, also made some profit which is always nice. Back to the online grind for the sunday today #vamoooos #lfg
Return of Sunday morning watching the lad play footy. All week I picture them playing like Barca, the reality is very different. #YouthFooty
At least we won't face De Bruyne for Wolfsburg in the Champions League, or against City when they get Barca in the 2nd round
@ASR_Nick This is the Roma I wanna see vs Barca in Rome on the 16th. The match will be epic.
@OldTraffordReds I look at his past record 2 n it's awful nearly got barca relegated nearly finished 5th wif bayern b4 he got sacked
(Assuming Barca are the best team in the world) Who is the 2nd best in your opinion?
@EPHowie Did you not see my reply? Barca's front 3 tomorrow. Don't EVEN @ me.
Plus, Atleti still killing it. My heart may belong to Barca but I love the competition. First place may not be so predictable. (2/2)
Does Barca's transfer ban expire after tonight or on the last day of december?
@_suprene @sinTripas_ if he can play then I hope he plays against barca, on the 20th
So De Gea will be just like the Barca situation, can't play but is basically at the club because he should leave when January comes
If DDG is stuck here till Jan, can we offer him to Barca just to annoy Madrid even more.
Madrid and Barca run the La Liga, not a chance DDG won't be a Madrid player by tomorrow.
Can we just really piss Madrid off and sell De Gea to Barca in January
@cottonballfc very true I wish they would accept but I think we have a shot to get him in January and fight Barca for him what do you think?
@halamufc @swagattt @joelsimondsouza Personally I think Utd should just tell Madrid, the deal is gone and then in January sell DDG to Barca
Barca may have the best players, but they are miles away from having the best team. Look at that shit def. #barca https://t.co/N3uFl2XIam
Barca fans when they saw "UEFA will study the case tomorrow. They will make a decision on the De Gea case" http://t.co/BmV0wbjeoy
@ChampionsLeague @FCBarcelona barca will successfully defended the title, with the arda and aleix in January plus MSN I don't see them lose.
He was in the Atletico academy, Real is the biggest team in Europe next to Barca. All his friends are in Madrid. LOL https://t.co/AiCHWLTiU8
@AnderJuanderful when managers/players make it a matter of their ego then things always go bad. That's his problem.. 2nd stint at Barca e.g
Barca won the treble and had a transfer ban yet they signed two players. Arsenal came 3rd in the BPL and they didn't buy an outfield player
Ben Lederman may well end up being the first American to play for Barca but, for the time being, it sounds like he's heading to Florida.
Definitely Liverpool's anthem is the best, 2nd is Barca's one, love it!
Atletico Madrid is going to be dangerous..Pedro leaving is going to hurt Barca in the long run..no bench to rest MSN https://t.co/TD02TABov8

@Shehroze_MUFC we are 3rd same as Bayern after RM and Barca. why the fuck are you taking the name of that snake.
@tfaheel haha no, the first was just Barca and then I put the "|" just to separate for my 2nd club
Arda Turan got cramp, I am not surprised! Sign for Barca but can't play til January, what do you expect lol
@christhomas1190 he'll be ready in January for Barca!!
@andrewmperry the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now.
Can't wait for Arda to play with Barca, January na pls! https://t.co/RWRRFgDnf0
@Oo_Gho_Gho So Neymar being fifth and Eden being 6th shows nothing other than Barca did better than chelsea in the CL.
We are not Real Barca or Bayern that players would be ready to join the club as a 2nd/ 3rd choice. On what grounds would you bench Coq/Santi
Slowly getting my last bits pulled together for Barca! Gonna get everything finalised today so I can just relax tomorrow :)
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
@MoeAnabtawi Barca is the best team not Real .. no one can win over it ... and see u on Sat ;)
Batman still solid as hell. Love ya. See you tomorrow!
@Ssnyder1835 Oh c'mon, you write Batman! That means you get paid around the same amount that Bruce has right?...riiiiiight? :)

Murray has given it his all, which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but Federer just unbreakable. TB 2nd set. #CincyTennis
Federer beats Murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach #CincyTennis final. He'll be going for his 7th title vs Novak Djokovic, who is going for his first
Serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. Joins Djokovic and Federer in tomorrow's #CincyTennis singles finals. Decent trio.
Djokovic looks physically better than against Goffin &amp; Dolgopolov, he may beat Federer today; probably he played only 70-80% in previous RDs
Federer will have to serve into the sun here.
Love this new trick that Federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. Running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
Tiger, Federer, Serena, the Niners (eesh about those guys), and some cold TX brews. laaazzzy birthday Sunday.
Has Federer shocked Murray and Djokovic with his turbo-charged aggression? Will they respond? New podcast tomorrow http://t.co/oy9eqomY3L
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!
23rd of August was such a nice day, England lift Ashes, Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati.
Federer overtakes Lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the US Open in the Open Era. 15th straight year. Connors leads with 18.
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
@tsExtraTime @BenRothenberg Novak is surely the man to beat. Federer or Murray may run him to the base line. The usual suspects.
I believe #Rafa could win a 3rd #USOpen title if he can make it to the semifinals at least because of Federer, Murray, etc. #usopenworld

I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow!
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss.
@camerondallas Federer is about to begin his 2nd round. Go watch it.
Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!
Last year, majority of the Federer matches took place primetime.  This year, it's the other way around.  2nd on Ashe tomorrow
@SJauhar I keep trying to book as soon as I learn when Federer's playing - too late. Nosebleed seats for 4th round (!) going at $250.
@mmunro91 I may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than I just saw, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic included. Make no mistake,
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen
Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd
Just got to watch Federer win 4 consecutive points to get the decisive break in the 3rd set before mom snatched the remote citing god!

Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
Ok time to check back in with tennis - Isner and Federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el
Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... Lol wow
In French Open QF, Federer didn't break serve -- 1st time in Slam match in 13 years. Tonight he breaks for 1st time in his last return game.
Disappointing end to the match for Isner. Would've liked to see a 3rd set tiebreak but Federer is a robot. He's ridiculous.
@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak
With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g

ugh also i forgot hannibal is ending...i never kept up with it but i still feel pretty sad it was a damn good show, 1st season
ugggggggh I want to watch Hannibal finale but I am too tired. Perhaps when I get up tomorrow I will
I'm just sat here crying over the last episode of Hannibal #bye
@afooltocry @HorrorHoneys It's my uneducated opinion that Breaking Bad is the best show in the history of time.Hannibal might now be the 2nd
Hannibal finale on Wednesday in the UK. Time to catch up on all the episodes I missed while on holiday.
Tomorrow I will start catching up on Hannibal. I got to ep2 of S3 and had to stop because I wasn't ready for what a ride it was gonna be.
We're deep in Season 3 of HANNIBAL and Will Graham may have met his match with The Tooth Fairy http://t.co/aHbA8EnCJG http://t.co/fJP8d00hgs
After a disappointing end to the 3rd season of OITNB, now to see what Hannibal is all about.
@theofficialmads may I say sir your portrayal of Hannibal is beautiful and haunting. Hope you get this message. Look forward to ur next work
@WatIsEyebrow noooo not yet. We had a birthday date night last night. Plus I watch it on hulu, which means no Hannibal until Sunday :/
I would've preferred that episode 4 of Hannibal season 3 was the 2nd episode of it. would've been better to check on everyone earlier.
this has also been the 1st episode of Hannibal that had no tension, action or killing at all. also, almost no (new) Hannibal Lecter scenes.
According to my DVR, the penultimate episode of HANNIBAL is just the 4th quarter of a NFL preseason game. I could eat a face.
I may have a massive love-hate relationship with Hannibal but Bryan Fuller's heart has always been in the right place.
"Hannibal" may have ended but you can still express your love for your "murder husband" and Hannibal with this... http://t.co/lWUppYXjkk
I'm going to be so tired tomorrow but all I want to do is reblog Hannibal related stuff on tumblr. *cries* #Hannibal
Binge watched Hannibal all night and I may have just checked under my bed for a killer. #adultlife
I thought I had enough strength for the Hannibal finale. Tomorrow is lost.
@wylerette it may be called Hannibal but the show does revolve around the both of them plus bryan said they are meant to stay together
We've got to wait until Wednesday night here in the UK for the Hannibal finale yet I've pretty much seen it all in gif form
I met Em and Blaine through Hannibal. I may have my issues with the show but I'm modest enough to respect that.
I'm crying! :O  Thank you @NBCHannibal for giving Hannibal a home for 3 years, and doing your best to keep it there  https://t.co/QJCCTlhNFS
Tonights a good stopping point. Tomorrow I watch the last 6 episodes of Hannibal, ie. the Red Dragon arc.
I loved the Hannibal finale Saturday. It was good enough and open enough to interpretation to please all types of Fannibal. #HannibalMicDrop
The moment I truly fell in love with Will was at the beginning of Sakizuke, when he plays Hannibal for the 1st time. #Hannibal #rewatch
What Mads may want to everyone when he received the script full of Hannibal's vocabulary or intellectual talk LMFAO http://t.co/JyYyV5nj2n
I dream of a world where not only is Hannibal in it 4th season but we're also looking forward to a Hannibal vs Dexter Halloween special lol
Bit concerned my brother hasn't read the facebook message I sent him asking him to bring me the last 2 episodes of Hannibal tomorrow.
"Nashville, Hannibal, &amp; Empire, I may've named you after TV that was popular at the time of your conception, but you are still my triplets!"
Kristen Bell for Clarice Starling on Hannibal in the imaginary 4th season that will never exist.
@ReadyP2 I'll send you a pic tomorrow. It's out in the garage and I'm far too comfy in my slippers watching finale of Hannibal ;)
Gutted that Hannibal has finished,really hope someone pics it up for Fuller to do a 4th season or even a movie,sure @pashley13 would agree
@DrHLecterMD @lecters_imago / You portray Hannibal beautifully may I just say.
Love all of you, thanks you guys for showing me a new Hannibal! -Fannibal https://t.co/J7LeR8VKp9
@BlueRule24 @brasspetal kinda me on Tuesday lol I was numb and done with Hannibal it was scary. Hopped back on the feels train on Wed tho
My mum just asked me what we're supposed to watch now on Thursday nights since Hannibal is over ;A;
@lilmacmillan I'll be Abigail on Saturday and Hannibal on Sunday :D If you think you see me shout loud and I'll probably hear it~
Also @unwoman gets into town tmrw! Sunday + Monday I'm going up to Hannibal to see her (and various other friends) at the steampunk expo.
I have packed just about everything needed for #Tracon starting tomorrow. I am now allowed to watch a couple episodes of Hannibal and knit.
Just sat down to watch the final episode of Hannibal, Season 3. Incredible show!
I'm so excited for the new episode of Hannibal tomorrow *cries*
@SharingTheGuilt -may try and poison me? Hmm?" Hannibal stood straight, he said that in an almost sarcastic tone but this was still a cat -
@someotherworld @brasspetal @DarklingGrotto we need to reach the speed of light, we may need Hannibal's help
I'm going to binge watch Hannibal tomorrow night. Anyone wish to join me? @d0wninunderland @scully_snails @whatacunningboy @someotherworld
Hannibal gets another TD w/ 10:03 left in the 3rd quarter, extra point no good. Boonville is down 30-7.   .@KOMUsports  #FNF
@emmacaulfield 2nd only to Hannibal in best show of the year. Who was knocking at the door??? #MrRobot
@eddus We've gone for Hannibal over trash but still, lazy days! Am excited to see you and catch up tomorrow. Hello to R.
@BryanFuller Just rewatching the 2nd series finale of Hannibal for the nth time. Not enough words to explain how much it all means to me!
@alfredosaucyy it was on thurs :/ it was a last minute secret show at club bahia. it was so dope! Hannibal and donnell rawlings came thru
@BrianPerNiceDay @lecafedufacade So used to watching Hannibal on Saturday I am shocked I am going clubbing. #Hannibal #FannibalsArentDone
hehhe heres the last of the Hannibal stickers im making.. ill reopen my store with all the Hannibal designs tomorrow! http://t.co/ZPGAqfrSET
@T4RD1S nah it was there for a few years. Breaking bad, first couple of seasons of GoT, Hannibal, mad men, 1st season of true detective, 1st
I start college tomorrow. I think today is the best day to start watching Hannibal
#Hannibal has been a brilliant series tho &amp; the fact we don't know if Hannibal is still alive leaves door open for a 4th season #Hopefully
@Vortex566 oo I need to get back in to Hannibal! Did season 1 then just kind of stopped. Yar, started last week. You got kids in tomorrow?
I'm getting up at 6 tomorrow so I sticked in and out Hannibal after I realized next episode has the girl waiting under beds to murder people
Okay I'm going to watch Dexter and Hannibal and get high and sleep because fuck Monday.
@Illessa Based on the 1st ep, Mr Robot seems a good series to go on to.It looks to respect the audience in the same way as Hannibal, a least
Let's be honest, Hannibal may be many things but he's not a rapist which disgusts me more than killing, cannibalism &amp; everything else.
While I was at Taco Bell I got to thinking about Hannibal. I might not be ready to watch the finale but MAYBE I could watch the 2nd to last.
@FrygtCanophilis Hannibal removes his hand from your forehead, Will's temperature was back again. He sat down beside the younger man -
@LowriBearman Thank you my love! And I have had a fab day! Distinct lack of Hannibal but I'll put that right tomorrow! xx
@TheEricGoldman Seriously, when people lament they didn't take the 1st possible deal for Hannibal, I tell them go watch Lost in La Mancha.
@FromPillow but idk when i'm gonna get around to hannibal and i know wonderfalls is just a season, so i may just tide myself over with that
I'll be sending off Summer and HANNIBAL tomorrow. It'll be a bittersweet day.
@SkyLivingHD I'm going to be lost without Hannibal on a Wednesday
Lots of crime action in Hannibal the past two days... check it out in tomorrow's @hannibalcourier
Jerry Vance may no longer be a Conservative candidate but maybe Harper can name him to the Senate. #elxn42
Unpopular opinion:  Harper is right to think Nats fans ditching in the 7th inning was brutal.  No sure he was right to say it though.
@JohnC1908 I pretty sure none of those fans regret not being there to see Harper strike out in the 9th on a pitch in the dirt.
@Lawson890 @AdamRubinESPN @msimonespn @ynscspds Goldschimdt? for leading a last place team? Harper? may not even make the playoffs lol
What a tool @Joelsherman1 is once again - Fans leaving in the 7th inning in Washington today is brutal.Period. No reason to go after Harper.
Harper's Worst Offense against Refugees may be Climate Record as rising temperatures add to chaos in the Middle East http://t.co/FqypEHSLKt

@Misesforever @Liz_Cheney If u keep Harper as PM I may well cross the Lake myself! U have one incredible leader. Balanced budget and all!
@dcsportsbog Harper will issue an apology through the team no later than tomorrow.
If Harper doesn't want fans to leave in the 7th perhaps he and his teammates should stop under performing and losing big ball games? #nats
yeah, Harper went 0-3 tonight. that doesn't mean he doesn't have every right to call out every single fake nats fan that left in the 7th
Choosing to read the transcript of the interview Mansbridge did with Harper due to the extreme 2nd hand embarrassment I'm bound to endure
@bruceanderson I feel it is 2nd rate. Mansbridge doesn't point out when Harper's not answering the question. Debaters would do that.
C'mon... It's pretty hard to form the Harper govt without Harper!!! Wait... maybe they have another Harper...  https://t.co/VomvlAJAOT
Now that he's in 3rd place in polls, Harper unveils inspiring new slogan: "I'm not perfect." Circling the drain time. #elxn42 #cdnpoli
@newbsradio let's go easy on the pigs. I just can't stand the sight of Harper. It's the 21st century...can't we teach robots to love?
@CBCPolitics Harper the CPC are going to become a 3rd place party because of your reckless leadership #stopharper #cdnpoli #elxn42
But for the first time since the writ was dropped, I really have no idea whether Harper will be PM after Oct 19th, or who would replace him.

Of many single issue reasons to reject Harper. This is one. Imagine the cost of removing all that concrete. #elxn42  https://t.co/hTwpHozGOT
@jenditchburn It's happened. Harper may try again. What said last night won't matter, it's cling 2 power by whatever means or pogey. #elxn42
@jenditchburn Harper's a 1 trick pony.  Throwing $ from a helicopter doesn't make up for clear lack of CPC vision.  3rd place &amp; dropping.
New CPC ad: Harper may not be perfect, respectful, reliable, accountable, truthful, but... wait where were we going with this?  #elxn42
@WrightHFX @NDP_HQ you may have principles but lack reality. Liberal far out perform Harper &amp; Mulroney's record. too bad
New election laws crreated by cpc makes it difficult to vote against Harper Even w/ 70% of voters against Harper, he may still win #fixed
@lynn_carleton The consortium too. I wanted Harper's hand to be forced &amp; w/ 3rd in polls, he'd have no choice. Mulcair let him off the hook.
"Harper spoke Tuesday on how the Cons will balance their security concerns with more refugees into Canada". Instigating hate #cdnpoli
CPC polling 3rd. Hate polls but I want to believe this. As individual CPC candidates come to realize that Harper is drag to them, Distnce?
Not sure when Harper chat is scheduled to end (may have already), but he's taken 19 questions so far. #cdnpoli #elxn42
Harper's NEW AD I am WHO i am not perfect but depend on me for economy  Harper slip sliding down the polls-3rd We KNOW WHO YOU ARE scares US

Anyone in Niagara tomorrow should note that Harper will be in Welland. The sulfuric smell won't be coming from the Netherby tunnel for once.
Mulcair, Harper and Trudeau still in close race after campaign's 1st phase. Leaders considering time-sharing the country.
Harper may be right, it's pretty empty in Nationals park tonight. #Nats  #Mets
Michael Den Tandt: Harper says he is who he is, take him or leave him. That may not be enough - http://t.co/XyLJ7qAGYV
@ThomasMulcair Thomas, you must use this against Harper even if it did come from Ignatieff.  http://t.co/9dlTXt8Fy5
Harper was right lol, Nats leave in the 7th
Shame all the fans that stuck around to see a six run lead blown and Harper make an out for the 8th time in two games. #Nationals
@maryb889 Still have the 9th &amp; top of order!  Harper walkoff homer!
OK, last chance for the #Nats. It's Werth, Rendon, Harper vs. Familia in 9th, down 8-7.
I hope all the fans stayed into the 9th to watch Harper go 0-5. #nats
Harper walks. #Nats now have two men on with one out. Escobar will bat next. Still 8-7 Mets in the bottom of the 9th.
@TedStarkey even a successful bunt puts us right they are now 1st and 2nd 1 out after the IBB to Harper. So dumb.
Harper upset with fans  http://t.co/29S9C9Suk6  When @Bharper3407 runs out every routine grounder to 2nd then he can complain about the fans
@KennyHerzog In this series the Nationals may have lost the division and Harper may have lost the MVP.
@TarekFatah Mulcair, Trudeau and May are all weaklings just like Harper. Mulcair must dubious and dangerous of bunch. Apologist for Isis.
Do #mets walk Harper if rendon gets bunt down?  Is Matt Williams under the weather? Pap in 8th facing bottom of order? Left storen out 2 dry
Armed with the tools of power &amp; intimidation Harper is trying to steal our country.  On October 19th, armed with pencils LET'S TAKE IT BACK.
Harper:NDP or Liberal Govt possible Harper's spirit broken tired of so Much Hate against him of his own making Given up the ghost Peace MON
@SouthpawSlinger @jonmorosi @FOXSports @FS1 But he's certainly been the 1st or 2nd best player in the NL overall, Harper and Kershaw better.
Harper doesn't want to see you leave unless you're stretchered off. #brutal  https://t.co/EKEi9TOC4A
@SBNationMLB @SBNation The idea that the Mets would have walked Harper if it was 1st/2nd no outs in lunacy.
@EvanLSolomon Harper gets first chance, most seats won get 2nd chance. Easy. Harper does not play well with others, ask Danny Williams.
@ian_wayne @P_Wog   Keep focus on Harper&amp; all these good things will be added unto you May the best man who wins the heart of Canadians

@ABCPolitics @ABC @DavidMuir OMGosh! HIllary still using her deceased Mom as a PROP to save herself from her own lies. ~May she RIP.
@ianbremmer @Eagle_Vision I'm sure Hillary kept a copy of all the original emails somewhere. Where is the 5th thumb-drive Hillary?
LOLing at Hillary apology...1st she said all of us were "confused" (a nice way of saying "stupid); now she apologizes 4 using server. #greta
@Patrick_Fogerty @SarahPalinUSA Sarah Palin, other women you disagree with may still be quite bright.Hillary may be intelligent, just wrong.

Did anyone see Hillary's Server Boy actually plead the 5th or did his Lawyers only do this in the media? @TGowdySC @greta @zerohedge
Hillary says.. "I understand that you may have more questions, &amp; I am going to work to keep answering them." ..huh? work to keep answering?
I believe we may have a major security scandal with prominent people involved in the unclassified Hillary server. Is there a cover up ?
Hillary can take her phony apology and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. She is only sorry she was caught it's all about power.

Reading @daringfireball's prelude to tomorrow's Apple event, can't help but think @gruber is the new WSJ, Bloomberg, or NYT re: iPad news.

Tomorrow, #Apple better introduce an iPad large enough for me to stand on, with an app that'll transport me wherever I want to go. If not...

#FF @innocent - not just for the drinks but for Jay-Z's 99 problems! 99 problems that we may just ponder about at some point in our lives!
Dear ppl who attribute vocal fry trend to Britney &amp; Kim K: have you ever heard Jay-Z talk? https://t.co/5kbwMWMcII https://t.co/TGIIFPwJwr
I'm crushed "It's a hoax: Jay-Z and Beyonce aren't trying to buy rights to the Confederate flag http://t.co/S3HTrCvXDP via @PunditFact"

My following may not be as big as Jay-Z's but I got a solid supportive growing following. Thanks for the love. #TeamM00Y0U
Aye now Meek may surprise us. You know when Jay-Z dropped Takeover they thought it was over for Nas. And then Ether......
May the best of your today be the worse off your tomorrow - Jay-Z
If you pine for a time when Jay-Z didn't suck, then listen to Czarface. Esoteric, 1/3rd of the group, is a dead ringer for his voice.
August 5th is Work Like a Dog Day. Because sometimes you just have to do what you have to do. Jay-Z said it well: can't knock the hustle!...
Imagine if Ether had dropped in the social media age. We may not have the same respect we do for Jay-z today.
3rd verse on 745 by Gucci the best diss verse period. He dissed Jay-Z &amp; Jeezy &amp; crushed that shit.
Prince confirmed that he and Jay-Z will release an album September 7. #PaisleyPark  #Minneapolis
#DALE: Get set to battle it out! @JoRuffin88 is dropping the beat for a Kanye Vs. Jay-Z ride tomorrow at 630pm! Grab a bike!
Jay-Z and Beyonce came to Taylor's 25th but not Kim and Kanye's wedding. Imma let Taylor finish, but she had the best birthday of all time.
Who Belong In the 3rd spot for top 3 of all time. Jay-Z, Nas or Eminem?
Enjoying how the Jay-Z vs. Abdel Halim Hafez lawsuit forces serious newspapers to put "Big Pimpin'" in headlines. http://t.co/WCBHI8g4ws
Jay-Z make time for Bey.. The President make time for the 1st lady. So where are you so busy at again?
Song Cry x Jay-Z is one of my favorite songs, don't screw over the one that's been dsd1 no matter what changes life may bring, just don't.
When you realize classes start the 9th so the AC/DC concert will be the best concert since Eminem and Jay-Z #thatwasgoat
@insanityreport @rodimusprime there's no middle ground with her though. Her Jay-z insights used to veer off into the 3rd testicle range

@JKailli Although you may know this better than I do since you're from California lol I'm not knocking Jay-Z view in black culture, I say
"We make a million of beats, cause our stories is deep. And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet." - Jay-Z
I was certainly not expecting @JColeNC to bring @Drake and Jay-Z to the Ville.  I may have dropped a tear or two.  Greatest show ever!
If Kanye became President, folk that wrote off the masonic/illuminati symbols in he and Jay-Z's music/vids as meaningless, may think again!
Jay-Z may have his big companies... And Beyonce but that doesn't amount  to what Nas has done for the world and the people.
Today during 6th it was dead silent in the library &amp; all of a sudden my iPad started blasting Jay-Z's voice saying "Motherfucker I got this"
Also the correct Top 5 is Eminem, Jay-Z, 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., and Ice Cube in that order with Big Pun as the 6th man
Jay-Z sat in that Interview like a God showing that he was truly ahead of his time while the other niggas flirting with Foxy Brown

Madonna's recent albums may not be very good, but never forget the great contribution she gave to music from 1985-2005. Two fucking decades.
@britneyspears I fell just like a lot of Madonna's old songs for real thats how I live I don't know about everybody else but yeah it may
@alauwasser If it keeps making money for HBO, they may have to start going to former colonies as well. Or even have to take Madonna.

Seeing Magic Mike XXL with my mains last Friday! #fridayfunday #unforgettable #tgifholiday https://t.co/4QErLEKSeK
I may not seem like the target demographic but let me tell u that I think Magic Mike XXL is one of the most excellent pieces of film making
Magic Mike XXL is better than the 1st. I learned a lot about the male stripper psyche &amp; culture (&amp; midlife crisis), &amp; female sexual desire.
Yes, Magic Mike XXL is a feminist movie, but the reason may surprise you http://t.co/3r5JTNDLMa
A FB friend of mine just posted that seeing Magic Mike XXL was the best night of her life. If only she knew what my typical sat night is.
What is this force that compels me to keep watching Magic Mike XXL? Saw it the 2nd time yesterday and am already ready to see it again.
Also, ace time with the uni ladies. Saturday in Stonehaven, barbeque, Magic Mike XXL, tons of food... hips hurt from all the walking though!
Mama: Shoti, i bought 2 tickets to a movie, the title is MAGIC MIKE XXL i don't know why is that the but watch it with me tomorrow. Me:.....

Going to bed, can't wait to see for myself the "anti-hetero male campaign" that Magic Mike XXL is apparently leading tomorrow.  Goodnight!
Omfg? Magic Mike XXL was on cinemas last July 1st and I didn't even get to see it bummer :--(

So, I may have disturbed some of the other filmgoers at MAGIC MIKE XXL when I squealed just a bit at @TheVickyVox's scene.
I was SO disappointed with Magic Mike XXL!!! If it would have came out first, I dont think I would have watched the 2nd one.
@channingtatumsaw Magic Mike XXL. 4th time. If you think it's just about stripping.....you would be wrong.....#YOURbeautyisenough

They may be different types of players, but don't say Messi and Ronaldo are the best. Not yet anyway. They might be remembered that way
Messi has ALWAYS scored in the 1st or 2nd leg of the CL Round of 16 since the 2007/08 season: 2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 6 - 2 - 1 (ongoing)
Bale is a great player, Messi may have to drag with him this season, and I think Bale feels strong.
What a great cover for the 1986 winner....I feel @francefootball need to do something very special for Messi's 5th. http://t.co/ixSDV38UhN
Messi and Ronaldo both go up a rating in FUT 16 with Messi a 94 and Ronaldo 93 Suarez is a 90 as 3rd best player in the game.
Hahah Lol so Halilovic was shaking when he saw Messi for the 1st time. I'ld probably faint if i ever meet him.
3-0 Lavezzi on fire w his 2nd goal. Too bad he couldn't do it in World Cup or Copa America. Crowd still chanting "Messi" #Argentina #Bolivia
Whoaaaa...! #MESSI's show is on.. MESSI with the 2nd Goal... MESSI scored a brace. The greatest ever has destroyed them. #ARGvBOL
@THEHOLYDEATH_7 tbh this game is bunk...I just wanna watch Monday's game with Messi
@SivanJohn LOL the finishing was quite similar to Messi's 2nd goal against Bayern.
@LeslieeAndradee Messi scored with his 4th touch like omg! Like it's not fair.
Messi takes the number 1 spot 94 rated while Ronaldo comes 2nd rated 93 in FIFA 16 interesting #fifa16 #rivalry
James Rodriguez is fast closing in on the 2nd grade of best footballers (those immediately after Messi and Ronaldo)...
And eclipse the amount of wages Messi gets a week? Haha..so now who is the best, Neymar or Messi? #mufc #FCBarcelona https://t.co/kaWhNJCp3B
Bullshit! That would then mean you'd piss off Messi. Then have to pay him more too.  https://t.co/MeABTj2Bvx
Messi has scored 10+ goals outside Camp Nou for the 6th consecutive season: 25 - 21 - 23 - 27 - 32 - 10 (ongoing)
barcastuff: Messi is the 1st ARG player in history to score against all other 9 Conmebol countries #fcblive [via mrchip]
25 - It has been 25 matches since Messi last produced a hat-trick for Barcelona. His next will be his 25th for the club. Omen?
Iniesta is the 3rd best after Messi and Ronaldo, no one comes close, not Neymar not Hazard #spain
@DerekRichards @MarkWarburton9 Is that Messi's twitter name or has the Mexican sun fried your mind?
Imagine having a 20th of Messi's ability. You'd be the best in your team
Sunday Supplement. Is Bale in the same class as Messi and Ronaldo?! "He's knocking on the door" don't make me laugh. Over hyped as always
Nice to be in the @guardian_sport YouTube round up. Mine is the last link - Messi is the headline. Surely a mix-up?! http://t.co/KheYatUISH
Initial pass to Messi zipped in. Only he could tame the ball &amp; pass to Xavi 1st time. Minimal backlift from another planet. @Phase_in_out
I'm sad I can't watch Messi and the Argentina squad on Tuesday :(
3. The AT&amp;T Stadium will have a great atmosphere on Tuesday, where we will face the likes of Messi and co. http://t.co/7CIPhYiz1d
I may not have gotten a picture of Messi, but I still saw him with my own eyes! Fuck what everyone else says lol
@Omsondafivenine @Footy_Jokes this is the truth my friend while messi might win the 5th ballon d or people would say Ronaldo didn't win it
@CulesAmericano Messi has the 6th best dribble succes rate (81%) in Europe's top 5 leagues this term of players to attempt 10+ dribbles
Messi and Ronaldo please, but it seems we will be stuck with the duds that let us all down on Friday.  https://t.co/ftu8tveLku
*talking to Gunny about who's playing tomorrow*  Me: Messi and then some Mexicans that you don't know  Gunny: that's okay. I like Mexicans
Sum chelsea fans in their dreams believe Hazard is the 3rd best player in the world afta Messi and Ronaldo. Not sure they've heard of Muller
Messi, I'll see you tomorrow don't worry
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
He can't dribble cos in Spain (like many EU countries), dribbling is seen as disrespectful, he has to play 2nd to Messi...

@CoutinhoRed @TaintlessRed Messi is on another level to CR and James is not the 4th best player in the world...
Have uni tomorrow morning but need to say bae Messi tonight. its my drug.
And people still doubt @WayneRooney  absolutely comical. He may not be Ronaldo and Messi but he's our best player by a mile
2nd time having ronaldo and Messi .... Plus a cheeky hazard on the bench !! @Castro1021 @TheReevHD @Nick28T http://t.co/4FlPAPpqnk
Messi will now attempt to break Telmo Zarra's record on 22 November when Barcelona face Sevilla at the Camp Nou
The Nats may have sucked again but now Messi is on TV and Colbert is back in an hour so it could be so much worse.
Messi may be the best player in the world but Chicharito is the best player in the universe #ChichaDios @CH14_ http://t.co/BbPKl2CfGj
Messi slips on sod laid over turf. Grass pitches all over US, this is stupid &amp; dangerous. Glad Kun has sat the first half. #MCFC
Messi needs to show up more in the 2nd Half. #mexicovsargentina
12:26am and we've got US Open Drama, Colbert's debut, and Messi just scored a sick goal for Argentina.  All Live/1st run now.
And that is why messi is the best in the world. Good game though. Now to wait till October 10.
And Argentina say Messi does nothing for the national team??! That goal was just magical Messi time as usual, c'mon! XD
Somebody get a mustache, a fake birth certificate and get Messi signed up for the US on October 10th, please.
So according to my 12th Grade English teacher Messi has now tied the game up? Can anyone confirm this?
@randomhero23 because they did not reply the play as much. 2nd time Messi scores a goal on Mexico like that
Very proud of that 2nd goal from Mexico! Even tho they didn't win (nothing new) props to Messi for the last min goal http://t.co/MMbK3Z706L
APOEL can become the 24th different opponent in UCL against which Messi has scored at least 1 goal. He has faced 31 teams in total
In 2 days Barcelona will play the 1st UCL group stage game of the season, at home vs APOEL. It will be Messi's 31st opponent in Europe
Sometimes I just feel sorry for messi and cr7 that such immense talents may not add the world cup to their laurels....fuck!!!
@TeamMessi May i have permission to use this photo of Messi holding the case I designed? http://t.co/OJpKZ9qWga Ta! http://t.co/48IJDs944Q
@Fraudiesta I agree with Messi being 3rd but my top 3 would be:  1.Hazard 2.Suarez 3.Messi
But Messi made the former premier league champions look like a group of 11 lads at goals  https://t.co/fAPDWwbX0d
Messi and Barcelona will resume La Liga action with a traditionally tricky trip to Real Sociedad (Sunday, kick-off 21:00 CET)
You may dislike either Messi or Ronaldo, but you can't dislike Zlatan.
May as well scribble out the 5 on the FIFA 15 disc and replace it with a 6. Basically identical bar Bale's hair &amp; Messi's tattoo. Shambles.
Today is Metlife. Jesus is coming back its the 2nd Easter. All wars have ended &amp; ceased fire in the stadium. We all gained superpowers.
