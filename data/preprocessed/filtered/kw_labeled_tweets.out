My god the sheer number of people that drink the Kool Aid of the #GoP and #Democrats and think that they are different flavors is astounding
according to a recent poll, 5 out of 4 people are offended by mitt romney
@MittRomney, you have great hair. #romneyryan2012
I hate #election years. Keep your ads off #youtube!
I can't stand hearing @BarackObama lecture me about how unfair this country is. Good thing he's only got a few months left! #RomneyRyan2012
@TwitchyTeam - that's fair the rest of us aren't satisified with Obama's manipulated certificate of live birth.
I love Michelle Obama and her passionate support of her husband. She's immense! #firstlady #obama
#espn #urbanmeyer and #Obama all have a slobbering love affair together with this skewed media...is anyone else getting tired of this?
Who seriously encouraged Mitt Romney to run for president? He's like the Karen in every group, in a @DaneCook AND Mean Girls way.
@MichelleObama Clinton said it two days ago, and I will repeat it. Barack is lucky to have an intelligent woman by his side.
DEMS make sure you register and vote take your friends anybody you come in contact to vote The MSM is all out to protect and priase Romney
I support helping the needy, I oppose funding the lazy. #RomneyRyan2012
why is everyone already saying romney will win? am I missing something here? don't believe it, and make sure you vote
Thing is, this was 1st time #Romney was looking-sounding great and I was thinking 'hey there is something to this guy'. Just then, cut off
Cool I got to listen to Obama talk today he's so great omg
Y'all need to make sure you vote in Nov.!! They're strategizing &amp hoping that you don't! #Election2012
@brvz I would love to be there! We need more people to stand up and take back our country! #romneyryan2012 #rnc
Mitt Romney has been caught in so many lies publicly its ridiculous...and Paul Ryan is just an imbecile.. #MyOpinion

Regardless of facts presented that paints a clear picture of the truth, people will believe what they want to believe. #election
@hardballchris Great special tonight, remember GITMO closure was blocked by the #GOP
My only regret about two hurricanes washing away the #RNC is that not all of the #Republicans will be there.
Maybe once in my life I will win something after donating money to the Obama Campaign! One can only hope!

sad how politicians of this country put their pride above the people they pretend to work for. And no, I'm not talking about just Romney
So I had a dream that Obama came to visit my husband in our beautiful house. That was such a good visual of what life could be.
So 1st #Republicans hate the @MittRomney statement, but at the end of the week they are loving it? #Shady #Libya
Watching the replay of The Haters. Oh, I mean @FNTheFive . I think they hate themselves more than they hate #Obama @FoxNews #Romney

Dear #Republicans saying NO to the #DREAM #Act you may make a #country full of ignorant #people! You really #need it?
Polls are stupid. These two clowns haven't even debated yet. #election2012
#Romney has five sons? Im pretty sure that, statistically speaking, one of those dudes has GOT to be #gay. Law of averages people...
Obama wants to help all these other countries and borrow money from them but i think he should focus on the people first
@Motter241 lol now I hope Mr Romney gets voted in so a year from now when were in the same shitty economic position I can say 'i told ya so'
Saw Fox news aired a car chase that ended in suicide. Not really surprised. They've been airing Romney's for the last few months. #Gop2012
It's not even October and im tired of all these false claims being made by both campaigns. It's like a circus... #Election2012
#republicans are so awkward when put on the spot about liberal issues haha
@ClaytonMorris if that's what they're worried about, then I have a recommendation for a part of the gov that #Romney #Ryan should reduce.
No matter your beliefs or age, this will likely be the most important #election in which you will ever have the privilege to cast your vote.
Cool I got to listen to Obama talk today he's so great omg
My god the sheer number of people that drink the Kool Aid of the #GoP and #Democrats and think that they are different flavors is astounding

What I learned from SuperPac ads Mitt Romney likes to hunt sick Steelworkers' wives for sport from atop his dressage horse, Refalka.

Couple liberal Obama supporters just knocked on our door and asked if I supported Obama. My reaction No, he's a terrible president #Romney
@billmaher That's not true he really cares about us the commoners. Romney and his wife started caring after they lived one bedroom mansion
I hate itwhen the media says Romney donated so much charity, he donated it to his church. #election2012
I'm excited to be voting for the first time #OBAMA

In the mormon house, a woman has the right to scoot over to let the next wife in the bed. #obama #GOP #follow #akin
Correction @SagPhoenix @kybelle1957 @cspanwj The only problem #GOP supporters have is #Romney fearing being greedy &amp proud of it!

@davidaxelrod for me this election is about good VS evil,.and Obama is evil incarnate and so are you and the rest of you Communists.

#RomneyRyan2012 takes away titty Tuesdays. #ChadReed2012 wants the public to be happy. #fuckromney #realtalk
@MorningJoe how is #Romney talk about operating govt like private biz. Profits are fabulous, unemployment is high. How is that comforting?
As the #Election gets closer, would be great to find a way to focus on what's best for the U.S. instead of mud slinging! #GoldenRule

#RomneyRyan2012 thank you Mitt Romney for having the courage to say what MOST WORKING AMERICANS know...half the country is dependent!!
Fantastic speech by Obama at the #DNC2012 . Couldn't hope for a Democratic victory more.
Barack Obama came in offering hope and change. I believe I got more than my share of each. Do it again.
all I've seen is republican ads talk bout Obama. bitch tell me what u gonna do different ..................I'll wait #republican #democrats
 @agiantamongants b/c I did porn I dnt have right 2 spk my views?Hm absolutely do hella cool normal peeps new face of #gop
New #RomneyRyan2012 bumper sticker sighting in CoMo! I seriously get excited everytime.
After all of the sick things #Akin said about rape, he still might win, since #GOP is now desparate to win the Senate, &amp are supporting him.
Why does criticizing dependency on gov't hurt your chances for Pres. while criticizing dependency on God and guns is ok? #romney v. #obama
I think @MittRomney is right, #47percent of people were never gunna vote for him even before that video came out. Nice pick, #GOP2012
So I had a dream that Obama came to visit my husband in our beautiful house. That was such a good visual of what life could be.
really fantastic video - Mitt Romney and a gay Vietnam vet talk over New Hampshire's gay marriage policy #gayrights #election2012
@AgentOrchid OK - but Clint Eastwood miming slitting someone's (Obama's?) throat was more than sad, and met with no opposition from #GOP.
It's because of people like #ToddAkins that I refuse to ever vote for the #GOP. No matter how much I hate the dumbocrats.
So happy I got to see the president!!!! #obama
@GMA Joe Biden is like the head cheerleader, and, Barack the cute quarterback. I loved this pep rally.
@MittRomney, you have great hair. #romneyryan2012
@MSNBC we don't care about #Romney show more important coverage of #Hurricane
Who seriously encouraged Mitt Romney to run for president? He's like the Karen in every group, in a @DaneCook AND Mean Girls way.
Im tired of politics, I hope they go into hiding until November #election
Will Obama fire the person responsible for this statement? ... misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims
When #Romney says #Obama got every piece of legislation passed that he wanted, Romney sounds dumb. Right #CNN #MSNBC #FOX
That awkward moment you realize Mitt Romney Slogan, America American was the same slogan used by the KKK in 1922
I almost want to see Romney become president just to watch the usa crumble for being so stupid. #isthatbad?
Regardless of facts presented that paints a clear picture of the truth, people will believe what they want to believe. #election
@BLIGBUSINESS if you can give me one good reason why the NON millionaires should vote for Romney I might give you some bars!

It was nice seeing my grandpa &amp Carol. and it was comforting finding out they're #OBAMABIDEN2012 ...keeping my generation in mind.

Oh my god, they've gone mad. #GOP #Convertibilidad
America needs a strong leader, a man of integrity, honest, God's follower, can do person .... #Mitt2012
Romney is Anti-Union, Do you know we all would work for minimum wage and be forced to buy insurance on the Obama Care Plan!
Sheesh! All the DNC speakers are reciting the same handful of anti-Romney attacks like low job creation with a 4.6% unemployment rate!
Anyone else find it weird I get excited about stuff like the RNC tonight? #polisciprobs #election2012 #nerd
I think Romney will bring us middle class blatantly down to the gutters but I feel like Obama is secretly up to no good.
I shook Mitt Romney's hand!!!! I'm so excited!!!
Mitt #Romney even looks like a bad car salesman. If you're buying his shit, you truly have no sense! #Obama #4MoreYears

Romney wants to take away financial aid, that way he can start making our economy better. It's a good and bad thing.

Obama promised hope and change. Well the change is Americans have less hope. Don't give him another shot. #Obama
Obama Haters, loving the poles that just came out today? Pres Obama has a 6 point lead over Gov Romney. #ObamaBiden2012
Honestly, given the parade of birthers, loons, and jerks scheduled to speak at the RNC, less convention is probably good for Romney.
Is anybody else excited for debates to start? No? Okay. #Election2012

I fucking love @BarackObama #democrat4ever #Obama #love
#AreYouBetterOff yup! Nearly tripled my income since 2008 nothing to do with #Obama just hard work and smart choices
@AzureGhost You're just pissed Eastwood made a fool, and rightfully so, out of Obama. He's an empty suit in an empty chair. It is what it is
@hratcliff @ilanakats Oh absolutely. There'sa chapter about Romney and Obama + tricks used by both sides on and off the stump!
RT @fozisland This #GOP2012 #RomneyRyan2012 lying is a new low. May it bite them all in the ass, hard, and shame them into oblivion. h ...
The #Republicans pushed the van over the hill &amp they are blaming #Obama for trying to halt the free fall?
Not really concerned where Obama was born. Very concerned about his current residence!
Really excited to watch the presidential debate tonight, I hope they start calling each other names #debate #election2012
Obama promised hope and change. Well the change is Americans have less hope. Don't give him another shot. #Obama
Traditional Marriage in the good old days- trading a daughter for cows, land, or governing power. #equality #HRC #obamabiden2012 #DNC2012
So Romney being successful in life and having more money than you means he shouldn't be president? #gimmeabreak #RomneyRyan2012
 Hitler was a great speaker too. #RomneyRyan2012 wait what...?
Neither Romney nor Obama were the best candidates for this election, and all of your extreme left and/or right views prove your stupidity.
How r u worthless losers? I mean #republicans, er i mean #americanpeople doing? Sorry #romney moment! I sincerely apolgize, knd of?
Over 20 countries hate the USA. I'm Confused, does that include the republicans in this country that hate Obama.
Anyone else find it weird I get excited about stuff like the RNC tonight? #polisciprobs #election2012 #nerd
I guess this was it,Mitt. Too bad you wasted all that money on campaign spin&amppropaganda,then blew it.Good for 98% of Americans #election2012
Barack to Mitt You were right, it WAS a terrorist attack...I forgot about all that 9/11 stuff. Can I ask you a question about Iran, too?
Phoning-it-in headlines 'Will Team Romney Go Bold?' Wasn't Ryan suppose to be the bold flavor you're craving? Give it a rest.
Please don't get me wrong, I hate all politicians. The media coverage of the strip clubs in Tampa just leaves the #GOP wide open.
So excited to hear the @PaulRyanVP speech tomorrow. Economy is the main issue of this election and he is the best man to talk about it. #GOP
@coldilox Re Obama. I love him I love him I love him I love him. That is all.
@MobileMollusk I love the trains. When Obama first started talking about high speed rails?! I'm so down for that.
So sick of seeing #republicans on tv already.
Ryan strategy Distract everyone from his disastrous Medicare plan with guns and religion. The sad thing is, it will work. #election2012
@Cosmopolitan #Election Even as a Canadian citizen I can see how bad Romney would be for your country. He would obliterate human rights.
Mitt Romney moved so far to the right that he chose a running mate that solidified anti women legislation and continues lie to Americans
Romney is Anti-Union, Do you know we all would work for minimum wage and be forced to buy insurance on the Obama Care Plan!
@julijuxtaposed At least Romney's not pretending to be the great hope. At least his politics matches his party.
Some people can't handle the truth, you can tell by vile crap spewing from their mouth after the facts are given. #truth #RomneyRyan2012
RT @SissyWillis I'm thinking Romney must have some good internal polls. He looks relaxed, confident &amp, as I said before, #president ...
RT @chrisrockoz RT @chrisrockoz Scandal erupts as Pres Barack Obama is exposed as a Christian who cares about minorities. #GOP2012
Pretty annoyed that I'll be a month too young to vote...#RomneyRyan2012
I hope people have enough COMMON SENSE to do what's RIGHT and vote for OBAMA!! #Obama2012
Romney wants to take away financial aid, that way he can start making our economy better. It's a good and bad thing.
What do you mean the bus isn't going that way today?! Oh yeah Obama is coming #president #iowastate
It's possible you missed this, but the 4 people who are excited about #Mitt2012 are excited primarily because his name is not Obama, Barack.
Ole Jeff is gonna hate me by election time #RomneyRyan2012 @JDPTheRed
I love #ElizabethWarren! Hope she wins Massachusetts!!! #election2012
MT @TheFreds In your face Romney! #olymics2012 #paralympics the most successful games ever. &gt And that would be mouldy custard pie in face
#Republicans, you should be working today! Unions brought us this holiday, among many other wonderful things like weekends.
I hope every1 that camped out overnite 2 get the new #iPhone5 will also camp out 2 cast their vote this Nov.! #4moreyears #Obama/Biden
Obama Haters, loving the poles that just came out today? Pres Obama has a 6 point lead over Gov Romney. #ObamaBiden2012
Mitt Romney is buddies with anti-gay hate group leader Tony Perkins, to vote for #Romney is to vote for intolerance and hatred. #GOPFail
Mitt Romney is arrogant as hell. He has racism written all over his face.
@BlogHer has a revealing front page story about women who have worked with @MittRomney http//t.co/GUqHCRiG #Mitt2012 A great man!
First full day at @GOPconvention and can't wait to see excitement first hand #GOP2012 #americandreamproject
hhhh mr barack obama you are fountasstick presidentin the word ay love you
Oh great! We got 2 shitty ppl runny for #president. I wont vote for romney or obama! Thy both aint shit!
#Romney wants to dismantle culture because its the quickiest way to control people basic History
@billmaher When is someone going to praise @MittRomney and the LDS for their great and socialist tithing system? #Mitt2012 #Seriously
Pretty tired of the stupid, judgmental garbage thats spewed around at election time. Apparently I must hate myself for supporting Romney.
Are you voting for Barack Obama due to his race or due to your belief that he is capable to lead our country? #askyourself #teamMitt
Saw a clip from a #Romney speaking event. Boy, that crowd sure was..um..pale. #thewhiteright
Why does #Democrats and #Republicans working together mean that the #Republicans have to give in to the #Democrats demands?
Oh my god, they've gone mad. #GOP #Convertibilidad
I shook Mitt Romney's hand!!!! I'm so excited!!!
Honestly, given the parade of birthers, loons, and jerks scheduled to speak at the RNC, less convention is probably good for Romney.
The last time I saw a former movie icon talking to an empty chair Bruce Willis was having the worst anniversary ever #GOP2012 #SixthSense
@timpawlenty exit indicates #GOP #Romney knows the election is lost, so much for party loyalty
 Ann Romney just said the best days of her life were when she and Mitt used to pretend to be poor. #ObamaBiden2012
I know that it is #election2012 season but do not let your political ideals mix in with your job. It could be ugly
@AzureGhost You're just pissed Eastwood made a fool, and rightfully so, out of Obama. He's an empty suit in an empty chair. It is what it is
Really excited to watch the presidential debate tonight, I hope they start calling each other names #debate #election2012
@dccc Disgusted and scared. Terrified #ObamaBiden2012 won't happen and these racist lying bigots will win
Sometimes I wish I lived in a state where my vote mattered. Other times I'm glad I don't. #election #alabama #nonsense
I hope #Romney (or how ever u spell his name) campaign don't pull a George bush stunt wit the ballots. He look sneaky as hell.!
His Speech is actually great, #Clinton #Election2012
Stupid bitch ! RT @LesbiHonestNow Mitt Romney basically said all black people lazy &amp has no work ethic.. Ol'e cracker ass
@HuffPostRelig There is no indication that this election will be any different than past elections...&amp thats not good. #election2012
#Romney v #Obama in November. We should save them a job and lock ourselves up in our local #FEMA camp now, watch TV and pretend all is good
@haileybabyxO Lol i think Obama is the devil. That's why they put a horrible person to run against him.
@juliapearey Yes you can! As Barack might say. A bit of shameless self-promotion never hurt anyone o) x
Mitt #Romney even looks like a bad car salesman. If you're buying his shit, you truly have no sense! #Obama #4MoreYears
#Democrats thank nature for threatening #GOP convention in Tampa w/ a tropical storm. Republicans hope storm will hit Charlotte on Sep. 6.
I hope people have enough COMMON SENSE to do what's RIGHT and vote for OBAMA!! #Obama2012

2016 definitely makes me worry about what has/could happen but it's still hard to believe that all of that is true. #uncertainty #election

I Just went in on my facebook status. #iSupport #Obama &amp I'm not shame. I'm certain that I'm being unfriended as I tweet this. Ion care tho!
Another reason I love John Elway! #romneyryan2012

Watching President @BarackObama on Letterman .... I would love to have a beer with Barack...
@Cosmopolitan #Election Even as a Canadian citizen I can see how bad Romney would be for your country. He would obliterate human rights.
Watching @MichelleObama's DNC speech at a McDonald's in Ibiza (free wifi). Absolutely moved me to tears. #4moreyears #my #first #lady
The way @BarackObama deals with Libya could be a deciding factor in the #election --- Obama really has to play it smart -- #fingerscrossed
I love #ElizabethWarren! Hope she wins Massachusetts!!! #election2012
Honestly, given the parade of birthers, loons, and jerks scheduled to speak at the RNC, less convention is probably good for Romney.
@hendeezi we're the 47%! and proud. @BarackObama has it in the bag. maybe @PaulRyanGosling can do @SNL sometime. #4moreyears
She is SOOO stupid.. Bachmann Ads Blast Stimulus, Tout Stimulus Projects..#GOP #tcot #Obama2012 http//t.co/Wyh2C0cK
I personally think #Romney is dumb as fuck..
You must really hate the black guy if you're defending Romney's idiocy at this point. #tcot #p2

Clint will be the one laughing when Peter Jackson inserts Andy Serkis - playing a mocap Barack Obama - into that chair footage.
This convention is making me so proud to be a republican #mitt2012
@billmaher When is someone going to praise @MittRomney and the LDS for their great and socialist tithing system? #Mitt2012 #Seriously
Not knowledgable with politics, but Obama's speech @ the DNC was nothing short of inspring , powerful, and true #4moreyears
Not really concerned where Obama was born. Very concerned about his current residence!
Stupid bitch ! RT @LesbiHonestNow Mitt Romney basically said all black people lazy &amp has no work ethic.. Ol'e cracker ass
Instead of just cheering for your favorite team, and towing the line educate yourself on the issues you find important #election2012
