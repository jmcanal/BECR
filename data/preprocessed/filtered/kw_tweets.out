"@SwaggyEfor3 I had Arian Foster so I'm on 26 already, but having Luck and Hilton puts you in a good place going into NFL Sunday."
@Rich_Hardytime Megatron listed as doubtful and is benched by Lowe! But Arian Foster scores big Thursday night to give the pigeons a start!!
People said I was dumb for picking Arian foster with my first pick..which was the 11th pick. He's the 5th best RB so far
How wonderful to know that on Sat pm I will watch the glory that is Ashton's Symphonic Variations @RoyalOperaHouse and @BRB   in afternoon
I cant sleep im too worried about ashton and i have school tomorrow but fuck school i care more about the person who really saved me
So tomorrow my mom is getting surgery to have her gallbladder removed. Let's just hope that both she and Ashton recover quickly and easily.
ashton may love their bay area fans but little does he know we hate ourselves
they were talking about the teen awards on Sunday and they mentioned ashton being sick :(
People are making it seen like ashton has Ebola like I understand appendicitis is bad but c'mon guys calm down
"Hello Ashton. I may not be a crazy obsessed fan, but I really do like you. that literally just sounded crazy srry im so awkward @Ashton5SOS"
"@TheDFRankings @FFOP_EMT_Pous Mostly its the Patterson issue, Asiata is useless aside from a being decent 3rd down &amp; goal line RB."
"@4for4_John Got Asiata @ start of WK2, let him get two good games and sent him in a trade for a '15 2nd, same guy just offrd him bk for 3rd"
@DrewAngelozzi88 @ESPNFantasy Asiata may have a tough time against Det run D but I'd still lean him if I was playing it safe.
"@ccothron427 good point, I'd do that but I already wasted a dang RB spot with Asiata on Thursday lol."
"@Syed_Wajii yes, this is why Atleti attack isn't so strong :) I'm not saying RMA attack isn't great...just not as you may think."
@br_football @TimDCollins could say Moya did the same thing with worrying comment that Atleti's place is 3rd or 4th. I was displeased indeed
"Might see if Atleti can claw their way back into this game in 2nd half, but you get the feeling Siquiera needed to score that penalty"
"(via @FedeFerreira95) Alessio Cerci thought he'd scored for Atleti, ref deemed handball, 2nd yellow, off. Harsh. https://t.co/P9SlAri9Tv"
Which would mean Atletico Madrid would drop to 5th. Bilbao will give Real Madrid a game tonight like they gave Barca at Nou Camp.

"Not in the habit of blowing smoke ( you know where), but @BumperGraham piece on @ESPNUK on Messi's 10th anniv for Barca as good as it gets."

Anyone used @googleexpress? Not sure if $95 a year for next day is worth it. Think Amazon may have more choice. Cool to have option though.
Amazon is offering free two hour shipping or 7.99 one hour shipping. I'm going to have to try this out tomorrow.

Amazon Prime summary: great if you order loads of stuff, Sunday delivery, home essentials with Now. Prime video is a nice bonus.
Transparent is a good show, recommend it! On Amazon Prime though so if you don't have it you may have to locate another means of watching :P
Thought BBC lost @ripper_street to Amazon Prime but delighted to see it back on TV for 3rd series. Period detective drama at its best!

@BaltanII Risers will help for sure I think, just got a couple sets from Amazon Prime due tomorrow to see if I like them or go elsewhere
I'm kind of confused why my Amazon Prime stuff that shipped today isn't coming until the 19th-24th. That's certainly not two days.
@KingsHillChat love Amazon Prime just placed an order and it will be here by lunchtime tomorrow. Great for impatient shoppers like me.
@myk_saiten That's a great movie. It's on Amazon Prime too. I watched it for 3rd time last night.

@WEWS Amazon Prime day was success in record sales. beating Black Friday, I got great deals on TV audio. so it's not just tupperware
So the much mocked Amazon Prime Day? It outperformed the company's best Black Friday by 18%. Humanity in a nutshell. Look at the shiny.
@AmazonHelp Ordered PC parts on Amazon Prime Day, one day shipping, haven't received my item yet. It is now Monday. Very dissatisfied.

Her reaction may have been a nur awkward. But at least, Angela Merkel was honest telling the girl just how it is. #merkelstreichelt
I don't agree with Germany bailing out Greece for the 3rd time.Angela Merkel is retarded and this New World Order is a senseless stupid idea

@ApplWatcher I only changed to Apple iPhone 6 in June and I don't believe the cellular is as good as android phones imo
PSA:  Apple event starts in 10 minutes, a worthy distraction for ignoring whatever class you may be in.
@tyler_mercado "I hope the Apple event tomorrow is a 6s"
May be sick, but I'm still tuning into the Apple event thing at 10, because I want to support my babu.
@jeffkibuule I think the keyboard on the Surface Pro may be a weak point. Will be interesting to see what Apple does for hardware input
t-minus 10 minutes! c'mon Apple, gimme something good to obsess about and sell my body for
http://t.co/5w76Pj3U52  Feels weird watching an Apple event with so much suffering going on in Syria :-/
This Apple event makes me sad about landfills filled w/old iPhones but they I just remember the sun will go nova someday &amp; I'm ok again!
Apple's event is streaming in stereo.  May seem minor but as a audiophile, I just love and appreciate this.
Really excited about Apple Watches collab with #Hermes - so beautiful! The new models with a new OS update - everything is available Sept 16

@teroterotero it's too early. Though to be clear. Apple Watch is already the market leader. And best performing Apple product in 1st quarter
You may be tempted to swim with this new waterproof Apple Watch case http://t.co/tv2PuuXLjD #apple
First day since April 24th that I haven't worn my Apple Watch, and quite by accident. The day of glancing at an empty wrist begins.
@ChrisAtRocket #xAdHitYourMark No worries Chris, glad you loved the lime. Don't forget the Apple Watch winners are announced on Monday!
Skinner would love the Apple Watch will revolutionize education forever stories tomorrow.
Yep, so most of the free UCF shuttle; Apple Watch is cool Playing some this fine Sunday morning!
Apple iPad Pro might be announced on September 9 event along with smart bands for Apple Watch.
Still love how the Apple Watch mimics the 1st Generation iPhone Design http://t.co/HwDcgbF5We
The Apple Watch may become so addictive it keeps people from looking at what's truly important in life, like their iPhones.
What Apple Watch has reminded me hope it's coming sooner than March (looking at you Valentine's Day).
@sarm0161 I know what you mean. People are always shocked when I say my favourite game was Arsenal at Villa Park in 88 in 2nd LC replay
Own goal is in unreal Form. Scoring goals for fun. Just hope he comes back injury free. England and Arsenal's 12th man.
Caught Offside: Arsenal forward delighted with brace for England in 6-0 drubbing of San Marino http://t.co/t09aSdPGIc #arsenal
He may have been Arsenal, but you can't help but love Thierry Henry at times..... http://t.co/sD3GhvVrPe
I love Ozil but how on earth is he the 1st choice corner-kick taker for both Germany and Arsenal? What the hell does he do in training??
Why the press people hate man utd so much for is all of the press people they all is Arsenal fans mainly the sun and the mirror that's why
@Jameschild_ happy 21st James! Hope you're well and hope Arsenal treat my oh
Revealed: Arsenal's most injured XI, four players still in the squad http://t.co/swr9yitD4O via @MetroUK
Gemini - waxing Sun in your 1st house think about Arsenal's great show of character
A good few Arsenal fans still pulling for Giroud. Guess it's 3rd/4th in the league, Round of 16 in CL and maybe an FA Cup again.
I have a feeling Arsenal WILL beat Stoke on Saturday, especially as I'm lucky enough to be going, so excited ....
had great time in Barca, also made some profit which is always nice. Back to the online grind for the sunday today #vamoooos #lfg
Return of Sunday morning watching the lad play footy. All week I picture them playing like Barca, the reality is very different. #YouthFooty
Plus, Atleti still killing it. My heart may belong to Barca but I love the competition. First place may not be so predictable. (2/2)
@AnderJuanderful when managers/players make it a matter of their ego then things always go bad. That's his problem.. 2nd stint at Barca e.g
Definitely Liverpool's anthem is the best, 2nd is Barca's one, love it!
Heavy saturday, Barca. The rain was knowing that how much I love you ! https://t.co/cRGyvsKidC
@hotcheetos4 still got smacked by Barca. Wolfsburg went far in the Europa and BVB lost to finalists. EPL is 3rd.
@Hayles_101 the chap is in his 2nd season of a 3 year deal. He has done the business at barca and Munich and I'm sure he will do it for us.
@GailSimone maybe replacing people/ concepts we don't like in real life with heroic figures?We may not agree with Batman but he gets results
@jmilam71591 @DCComics  I hate that they have about 3-4 active universes around. Also, having to take from batman's villain stable? C'mon.
It's almost July and someone says they hate Taylor Swift and this girl put on a Batman mask and started lipsyncing it I think I'm in love

Playing Batman tonight, @AlabamaFTBL tomorrow and NFL in a week. This is gunna be a good weekend :)
Just used a colon. Holy Punctuation, Batman. It's nearly half-one in the morning. Sleepy Saturday.
@Ragashingo @Masterxtp1 Cody may be responsible for good in the way that Ras Al Ghul is responsible for Batman.
I'm so excited for tomorrow's stream! I say we play Batman all day then do some viewer games after :D should be a juicy one.
Thank you @RocksteadyGames ! Instead of beating up bad guys, Batman is beating up my PS4. This is the 3rd time your game crashed my PS4.
Remember the Bale's batman trilogy. 1st movie: Batman emerges as a new savior. 2nd movie: Batman is hated and casted away as a bad guy.....
I may be as excited for The Martian as Star Wars and Batman vs Superman, and just behind Captain America: Civil War. https://t.co/BOUQ9ALgFk

@nevona @BernieSanders I love Bernie Sanders, it's great you're spending your Saturday for his campaign.
Bernie Sanders is like your 8th grade class president who won the election by campaigning to have 3 hour recess and free cookies every day
Bernie Sanders joined a picket line in the sun &amp; after gave a 3hr speech. I'm significantly younger &amp; exhausted from putting groceries away.

May the Lord give you Jay-Z and Beyonce's kinda love... No way that relationship is fake or for social media
I am real mad that the replay of Saturday's Made In America Festival does not include Beyonce. Unhappy @TIDALHiFi subscriber!!!

Ruben Juarez was legit the Conor McGregor in 9th grade in the football locker rooms shit was sick.

David Cameron's willingness to arrange the #EU referendum rules suggests he's greatly concerned about the outcome. http://t.co/8vRa14K0cG
David Cameron is a disgrace. A migration free for all may not be the solution, but neither is turning a blind eye to it...
Is it the same David Cameron posing before TV Cameras on Thursday posing fabricated words of compassion who also preaches race intolerance?
David Cameron, The Sun and The Daily Mail make me physically sick.
David Cameron wakes. Checks Mail &amp; Sun front pgs  "Damn!"  Rubs out 'swarm' from speech &amp; replaces it with 'desperate people who need help'.
David Cameron and Theresa may get your heads out of the sand these people are fleeing for their lives and they try to come here to be safe

@XAsiaZoX @DavidDelano I'm doin good!! I fell at Disneyland on Tuesday, but I'm alive! Haha. Went to a CSULB event tonight; so much fun!!
My mom was like in December we can get you the Disneyland pass again I was like nah 4 of our premiums is 1 premium now. I'll go for free lol
Last day on our Disney Premier Annual Passes. Gonna get different APs tomorrow. The Premier AP is too much hassle when we go to Disneyland.
I was so close to not going to otra and go to Disneyland on the 9th-11th but my parents love me so much. Thanks
That feeling i used to get when I new I was going to Disneyland the next day is how I feel about going to the sparks game tomorrow haha
@bellathorne @Disneyland sad to not be going to Disneyland tomorrow

I think I'm starting to get sick &amp; it's not okay because I'm going to Disneyland tomorrow )-:
@xrocknroll It was at the bus station all lonely I was sad af BUT Draven n I were at Disneyland on Friday waiting for the concert lol
I wish I could spend my bday at Disneyland. But it's blocked, and it's a holiday, and it's December.
Still bitter about not getting to go to Disneyland this Thursday like wtf you don't tease that kind of stuff
On this day in 1955, Disneyland welcomed its one-millionth guest, just seven weeks after its July 17th grand opening.http://t.co/D8SOhK5QE7
As happy as I am to be going to Disneyland this Saturday, I wish I was going next Friday for Dapper Day instead.
That awkward moment when @jccaylen is in Disneyland and you're not.. You better be there when I go in November hint hint
I really hope I go to Disneyland tomorrow just because I didn't do my essay
Gonna be at Disneyland tomorrow. Hella excited. It's been too long. Come hang out with me and Getter and a bunch of other DJs!

Wait, people are surprised Erdogan was covertly riding the ISIS tiger? That's just dumb. http://t.co/kFFstMpQj9
Erdogan allowed ISIS to build a network of safe houses in Turkey. He now may reap the reward. http://t.co/sITuSpNAfL http://t.co/WRR6sk5SoA
To Erdogan, the prospect of an independent Kurdish state is more frightening than rampaging Islamists. #pkk #ISIS http://t.co/hP1y5n1F33
@durdurulan Erdogan cannot be allowed to get away with what he is doing.He lost the June 7th election and now is seeking to undermine it all
@dlepeska @TimepDC Dear David, I hope Erdogan's mentors won't translate into the Turkish ,otherwise he may use it against Egpytian leader :)
West should be ashamed of alliance with Erdogan who from July 24 is exterminating the Kurdish people! #Kurds #YPG http://t.co/dsN927zSnK
So cynical of the electoral board to make preparations for snap polls on Nov. 1 as Pres. Erdogan refuses to give gov-forming mandate to CHP.
Really not a good thing in the current regional context. Erdogan's playing with fire https://t.co/mYHPFkUY7p
@rConflictNews Very possibly he is right. Erdogan in low hours crises may have used Isis to win nationalists votes attacking Kurdish
If, Erdogan the terrorist, does not get removed and Abdullah Ocalan does not get released by August 30, turkey will be sliced in two
So tomorrow when I turn on the news, I want to hear good stuff, like how Erdogan is hanging from his balls with his penis in his mouth.
@PeterClifford1  I have not read the links yet, will do. Agree Erdogan is problem, Turkish people not stupid.  May not last til election.
@artisticforge @babydoll32407 @Kurdistan_Azad_ In the moment Kurds do may be what Erdogan wants, but AKP is responsible f. killing civilians
Award winning @yavuzbaydar is accused of "insulting Erdogan" he may face up to 5.5 years in prison. Shame on #Turkey https://t.co/uA5PzFlec4

It's a sunny SausageFest Saturday afternoon but if we are going 2 make it 2 church on time it's time to slow up the pace! Eric Church 2night

Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
Excited for the Federer vs. Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. Should be some great tennis!
Federer is my 2nd fave male tennis player of all time right after the great Arthur Ashe.
Has Federer shocked Murray and Djokovic with his turbo-charged aggression? Will they respond? New podcast tomorrow http://t.co/oy9eqomY3L
What a great day for world sport: Usain got his 9th gold, Federer claimed Cincinnati Title no 7 and I pumped some weights. #truepro
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!
23rd of August was such a nice day, England lift Ashes, Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati.
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time.
You'll love this. @FedfanTejal #BlastFromThePast, Federer, Murray, Serena, Djokovic. Its got it all. #WorthTheRead  https://t.co/4hducxvFiP
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves

Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
i out of 11 breakpts converted-not nearly good enough by Federer at #USOpen2015 . C'mon, Deliciano, you can beat Novak- Believe !
With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g
Three bands who could have challenged @ledzeppelin : 1st Jeff Beck Group, Free and Fleetwood Mac (with Peter Green).

3 bottles of Prosecco later, we're sat here listening to Celine Dion, Fleetwood Mac, Bette Midler.   Not gonna lie. I'm loving it!
I want to go to Fleetwood Mac so bad in October
Just found out I won tickets to see a Fleetwood Mac tribute band tomorrow night. Is it sad that I'm really excited about this?
Seeing a Fleetwood Mac tribute band tonight and a Selena tribute band tomorrow night. I am excited.
Whatever you looking out for, have a great Friday....  Fleetwood Mac - Big Love  https://t.co/HtPwO5fN8L  #btc #bitcoin
Houston peeps: Go see Rumours (Fleetwood Mac cover band from Los Angeles) at @HOBHouston on Saturday.  You won't regret it.
Tusk - Fleetwood Mac. Another great Sunday morning album (bit of a commitment but worth it).
I wanted to look nice for tomorrow but I'm probably just going to wear my fleetwood Mac shirt again.
@DanBirkitt ah good, sat in restaurant the other night Fleetwood Mac playing in the background both my kids sang along #proudmummoment haha
Friday &amp; I find myself listening to Fleetwood Mac yet again. Thinking I should make it a tradition; Fleetwood Fridays - take out included.
@HeatherMorriss don't worry. The other week I got paid Wednesday, then Thursday spent most of it on a Fleetwood Mac ticket #oops #priorities
@kelly_clarkson Seeing you tomorrow night in #Houston. Would love to hear you sing Landslide by Fleetwood Mac. #fanrequest

3 more seasons of Game of Thrones? C'mon! You can at least make 10 seasons...right? Is that too much to ask? Ok, 3 is fine.
Get back on the 16th, and have 25 days or so until move-in day at Northwestern, which I hope is enough time to binge watch Game of Thrones
Game of Thrones season 5 for free may seem too good to be true, but that's only cause it is. My day went back to being terrible.
@erin_yvette Hey Erin, when do you think Telltale is going release the 6th Episode of Game of Thrones? I really love that game.
@wmap heard great things about the audio versions of Game of Thrones (although the preferred reader did not read the 4th book)
Another new episode of Dragon Ball Super. Thank you Sunday's, you have given me hope until Game Of Thrones comes back in my life
I'm so frustrated with Game of Thrones and I'm only on the 10th episode

The Hound from Game of Thrones is making a Lemon and Pistachio cake on Sunday Brunch, bloody fantastic start to the day.
Day off tomorrow, going to use it to be very productive and by productive I mean watch a lot of Game of Thrones
Thank you to all the awesome people who supported the cast tonight! Game Of Thrones is amazing! Might have a suprise game tomorrow.
If anyone is interested, I have a pizza in the oven and the boxed set of Game Of Thrones on blu-ray #Friday #TurnDownForWhat

Hannibal has been the most amazing show on NBC. I really hope they get a 4th season. Bryan Fuller is amazing #Hannibal #HannibalFinale
ugh also i forgot hannibal is ending...i never kept up with it but i still feel pretty sad it was a damn good show, 1st season
ugggggggh I want to watch Hannibal finale but I am too tired. Perhaps when I get up tomorrow I will
@theofficialmads may I say sir your portrayal of Hannibal is beautiful and haunting. Hope you get this message. Look forward to ur next work
I may have a massive love-hate relationship with Hannibal but Bryan Fuller's heart has always been in the right place.
I'm going to be so tired tomorrow but all I want to do is reblog Hannibal related stuff on tumblr. *cries* #Hannibal
I thought I had enough strength for the Hannibal finale. Tomorrow is lost.
Tweet from the great state of Denial. New tv show called #Hannibal on thur at 10pm. The guy plyn Hannibal has good cheek bones. Im intrigued
Tonights a good stopping point. Tomorrow I watch the last 6 episodes of Hannibal, ie. the Red Dragon arc.
I loved the Hannibal finale Saturday. It was good enough and open enough to interpretation to please all types of Fannibal. #HannibalMicDrop
Bit concerned my brother hasn't read the facebook message I sent him asking him to bring me the last 2 episodes of Hannibal tomorrow.
Gutted that Hannibal has finished,really hope someone pics it up for Fuller to do a 4th season or even a movie,sure @pashley13 would agree
I'm so glad we're doing this. I'm so glad we're doing it on Saturday too. ha.  Hannibal isn't leaving my life nope! #Hannibal #EatingThem
I have packed just about everything needed for #Tracon starting tomorrow. I am now allowed to watch a couple episodes of Hannibal and knit.
I'm so excited for the new episode of Hannibal tomorrow *cries*
Hannibal gets another TD w/ 10:03 left in the 3rd quarter, extra point no good. Boonville is down 30-7.   .@KOMUsports  #FNF
Nearing the end of Season the 1st of HANNIBAL. I love it so much already I'm devastated in advance that the show stopped before Clarice.
@eddus We've gone for Hannibal over trash but still, lazy days! Am excited to see you and catch up tomorrow. Hello to R.
@BrianPerNiceDay @lecafedufacade So used to watching Hannibal on Saturday I am shocked I am going clubbing. #Hannibal #FannibalsArentDone
@Illessa Based on the 1st ep, Mr Robot seems a good series to go on to.It looks to respect the audience in the same way as Hannibal, a least
@Amirabiabdallah Dexter is great but give Hannibal another try, it gets better after the 5th episode :p
@LowriBearman Thank you my love! And I have had a fab day! Distinct lack of Hannibal but I'll put that right tomorrow! xx
@SkyLivingHD I'm going to be lost without Hannibal on a Wednesday
Unpopular opinion:  Harper is right to think Nats fans ditching in the 7th inning was brutal.  No sure he was right to say it though.
But hey, if you're mad at Harper, go to the game tomorrow and tell him how you feel for all 9 innings
@Misesforever @Liz_Cheney If u keep Harper as PM I may well cross the Lake myself! U have one incredible leader. Balanced budget and all!
yeah, Harper went 0-3 tonight. that doesn't mean he doesn't have every right to call out every single fake nats fan that left in the 7th

@newbsradio let's go easy on the pigs. I just can't stand the sight of Harper. It's the 21st century...can't we teach robots to love?
@NEWS957 Harper &amp; cabal insult the intelligence of Canadians on a daily basis. Tired of all the lies &amp; spin. Roll on Oct 19th! #auditthisPOS
@jenditchburn Harper's a 1 trick pony.  Throwing $ from a helicopter doesn't make up for clear lack of CPC vision.  3rd place &amp; dropping.
@CBCNews Trudeau may do better if he attacked the NDP, no need to waste time on Harper the Media is 24/7 with the anti Harper narrative
@WrightHFX @NDP_HQ you may have principles but lack reality. Liberal far out perform Harper &amp; Mulroney's record. too bad
@AdamRubinESPN I'm happy to see the #Nats sat Zimmerman over Harper...Harvey owns Harper #Mets
@ZuckermanCSN I hope someone asks Harper why the team bailed in the 7th inning
I hope all the fans stayed into the 9th to watch Harper go 0-5. #nats
@KennyHerzog In this series the Nationals may have lost the division and Harper may have lost the MVP.
@TarekFatah Mulcair, Trudeau and May are all weaklings just like Harper. Mulcair must dubious and dangerous of bunch. Apologist for Isis.
@ian_wayne @P_Wog   Keep focus on Harper&amp; all these good things will be added unto you May the best man who wins the heart of Canadians
@albertarabbit journey to ISIS. Harper is a dangerous man. For all our sake I hope he goes. Ours is early Nov but I can vote during ++

@BRADSPORTS @jaketapper The news is bad for her. Ergo, it may not be presented as the most happy thing for Hillary.
If you're bored, Ask Siri, "Hillary sucks big green donkey dicks" prepare to laugh like you were in 8th grade!!
This may or may not be true but it doesn't change the fact that Hillary violated the law
@ianbremmer @Eagle_Vision I'm sure Hillary kept a copy of all the original emails somewhere. Where is the 5th thumb-drive Hillary?
LOLing at Hillary apology...1st she said all of us were "confused" (a nice way of saying "stupid); now she apologizes 4 using server. #greta

Hillary just may be that stupid, look at some of her track record screw ups. History tells it all. https://t.co/nzgqhXONTl
Hillary cares only about Hillary. I choose to wait for a credible female to become our 1st woman president. Smart women aren't desperate!
I believe we may have a major security scandal with prominent people involved in the unclassified Hillary server. Is there a cover up ?
Hillary knew what she was doing She may want U 2 think she didn't That is her sneaky way of doing things She knew exactly what she was doing

I really hope my mom takes me Thursday I could maybe reunite with Justin ahhhh
I'm so happy to see that Justin got his 1st number on billboard after all he has gone through.
The video to Justin biebers what do you mean is so hot nd I'm sat here swearing like a pedo in a park lol saucy
i hope justin's concert thursday gets cancelled bc of the thunder storm thats supposed to happen
I just wanna say I'm so happy &amp; proud that Justin got his 1st #1 debut
Everyone give my good friend @SykeOnAir a follow - he's interviewing Justin tomorrow!
november 13th is gonna be a great day bc we're finally gonna hear the masterpiece that justin created
Well done @mrdrk99. And great job with Justin winning the 18s doubles. https://t.co/nK9nkfH03u
Justin just made his comeback &amp; released his 1st single and he's already snatching everyone's weaves:') he's the king of the music industry.
Justin Is lost in the 1st minute. No experience #elxn42
So I'm mostly likely going to see Justin on Thursday and I feel like I'm gonna throw up cause I'm so nervous. I'm not meeting him tho :(
I was 8 turning 9 in the 4th grade when I started to support Justin. Now Im a freshman in highschool still loving him to this day Time flies

87 years of Italian Serie A history produced a first for Juventus on Sunday: they lost at home on the opening day of the season
@HoldTheMilan Chelsea and Liverpool lost now I hope Milan wins and Juventus lose tomorrow and it will be the perfect weekend
Juventus! "@SerieAlive: Roma v Juventus kickoff #SerieA Sunday. Who do you love?"
@mast84 how much more? (to be clear I hate Juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. They may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly
This is very bad for Juventus. Lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss Pirlo, Tevez &amp; Vidal already :(
Juventus hopeless without their 3 key players and a poor transfer window. Hope the cunts end up 5th in the league.
Juventus had two men sent off as their dismal start to defending their Serie A title continued with defeat at Roma on Sunday.
De Rossi believes Juventus may struggle to cope this season as he does not think they have adequately replaced Tevez, Pirlo or Vidal
If Draxler news is true, Juventus has been humiliated this transfer window. May be leaving without the trequartista they need and 0-2.

Weird Madonna concert dreams this morning. Speaking of, I have extra tickets. Let me know if you're interested. September 16, MSG.
the most important thing madonna has ever said is " don't go for 2nd best "
@THR She has the right to disagree. I hate Madonna! But don't think she should be stopped singing her shitty songs. 1st amendment, bro!
@CeciBeaEle Yes, it impressed me I was there in person last September, almost exactly one year ago...The Madonna is huge, so beautiful!
Madonna's recent albums may not be very good, but never forget the great contribution she gave to music from 1985-2005. Two fucking decades.
@heather_chorn @RebelCiccone I going on the 9th hope to find it hope you guys to good luck to all of us Madonna fans
@jsethriley Great what a cutie and it was nice to see your face on there omg Madonna coming back on stage 1st time I am on the internet
Yes, Magic Mike XXL is a feminist movie, but the reason may surprise you http://t.co/3r5JTNDLMa
Also, ace time with the uni ladies. Saturday in Stonehaven, barbeque, Magic Mike XXL, tons of food... hips hurt from all the walking though!
B texted me and told me that she &amp; her mom went to see Magic Mike XXL (she loved the 1st one) and she hated it.
I have surgery inside my face tomorrow, so stockpiling good feelings by going to the cinema with @RossalynWarren to see Magic Mike XXL.   A+
I'm taking my women's networking group to see Magic Mike XXL tomorrow and many of them are over 60 so this is going to be a good time.
Dear all people I know who are attracted to men:  Go see Magic Mike XXL.  Fair warning - you may fall madly in love with Matt Bomer. *swoon*
Going 2 see Magic Mike XXL for the 4th time tomorrow!  After watching this scene, no explanations needed, GOOD NITE! https://t.co/MJcwfZtocA
A select person keeps reblogging certain set pieces from Magic Mike XXL onto my tumblr dash. Sis. SISTER. May God bless and keep you.
Magic Mike XXL is going to be hilarious tomorrow @BeethCX
Magic Mike XXL may be my favorite movie of the summer. I was smiling and laughing the entire time.
You bet your bottom dollar I saw Magic Mike XXL for the 2nd time tonight and loved every minute of it
So Magic Mike with @jack_l_smith was super great. Tomorrow I'm going to see Mission Impossible, but all I wanna do is watch Magic Mike XXL.
@guardianfilm I think they may have used up all the sexy earlier in the summer with MAGIC MIKE XXL
So, I may have disturbed some of the other filmgoers at MAGIC MIKE XXL when I squealed just a bit at @TheVickyVox's scene.
I was SO disappointed with Magic Mike XXL!!! If it would have came out first, I dont think I would have watched the 2nd one.
Attention, Queens. I finally found a good copy of Magic Mike XXL so I will be watching it a 3rd and 4th time with whoever hasn't seen it yet

@Badandy538_ At the end of the day,  we're talking about great players so any argument against may sound like nitpicking. Messi is GOAT tho.

Facebook just achieved 1 billion active users in a day on Monday. At its peak, 1.1 billion people carried a Nokia phone with them.
so my phone is the nokia phone with the bomb ass camera so tomorrow i'm gonna try to take some good pictures of rbb and baby
The pics were taken on a 2004 Nokia, and it's really blurry and may induce cataracts. Just a heads up.
@wmpoweruser BBRY's route is more similar to Nokia though, both had great market share, in-house OS and then going with 3rd party OS

@JoyAnnReid Fractured got me thinking. Could part of Bernie's surprised rise be the sense Hill may move party back to the right from Obama?
Obama may be the President of the free world, but he's the King of dad jokes.
@LilMissRightie rather than "be strong so we can lift others up" the Obama doctrine seems to be "make USA unsecured &amp; chaotic as 3rd World."
@MSNBC @HillaryClinton of course she does. She's running for Obama's 3rd term. More free stuff &amp; abortion.
Obama's going to @MacombCollege to talk about free college. It isn't the 1st time he's used it as a backdrop: http://t.co/oApgsTgRAq

@SGgrc Oracle DID NOT bring us Java.  Sun (and James Gosling) brought us Java.  Oracle was just responsible for crapifying it.

Planned parenthood may give other free services to people who need them but it is only the top provider in one thing: abortions.
These Planned Parenthood commercials are beautiful b/c they inform the public that they are so much more than what many may think to be true

I am glad the Sanhedrin is back in business (because of the 3rd Temple) and will be trying Obama and the Pope in absentia Well deserved.
We just had a great time with Joyce Coronel with The Catholic Sun.  She interviewed several families who are going to see the Pope.

I hope Ric Flair prevents John Cena from getting his 16th title. Wwe write that into the script @TripleH @StephMcMahon
Odd because Cena and Nikki were seen laughing with Ric Flair Saturday or Sunday. https://t.co/b8NpoeiHMr
I hope that when @RonFunches wins @midnight for the 16th time, Ric Flair comes out to congratulate him. Unless Jon Stewart interferes.
I just took a Coach Freeze clip out of the new @HeadtoHeadRadio intro, to make room for Ric Flair. I love my job. New intro debuts tomorrow!
@LaurenceWHolmes What do you mean, Laurence? The Dudleys, Ric Flair, and Sting were on Raw Monday. Taker wrestled Sunday. It IS the 90s.

Pls CNN why in a world u bring this idiot Sarah Palin on Sunday great news program state of the Union CNN u really fuck up my Sunday
@CNNSotu @SarahPalinUSA  Sarah Palin may be a stupid cow  -- but she is our stupid cow. We love her
What a wonderful Sunday. We've already received great insight from the best of the Republican Party (Colin Powell) and worst (Sarah Palin)
I think Sarah Palin may have a health issue . I had a hyper - active thyroid and I still can't remember all of the odd things I said &amp; did.
I miss when Sarah Palin was a bigger deal, she was so easy to make fun of. Saturday night live got so fucking lucky with her.
She may have said "speak American" but Sarah Palin is right. Any immigrant to a foreign country needs to learn to speak the language there
Some low hanging Monday fruit:  "Sarah Palin says immigrants to the US should 'speak American'" http://t.co/aaKybqiLbK
Sarah Palin says US immigrants should speak "american", does she mean Navajo or Sioux? http://t.co/SLfVeoMb6C
@guardian "Speak American" that may just sum up how stupid Sarah Palin is. I thought they spoke English in the US or a bastersised version.

@Petapup1 @S3nt13ntB31ng @SaculSacul won't  be the 1st time SCOTUS violated the Constitution &amp; won't be the last.
@magicalvidyacat Seems fitting that there's a parallel there, and that SCOTUS used 14th Amendment to override the 10th. @Rinaxas

@rbassilian @souperfan2013  Actually there were many laws passed by many people in the states, SCOTUS just ignored the 10th Amendment
@jspoupart @JoeC1776 no. Congress makes laws and the SCOTUS settles disputes. In this case, the 1st Amendment lost.

@israel4911 @Letha_Hughes It was the 14th that SCOTUS ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality. News not your strong subject.
@LeeAdams_4Him purpose of the SCOTUS is to establish constitutionality of laws. they ruled that gay marriage bans violated 14th amend rights
@Billd111 @megynkelly @tedcruz SCOTUS has determined that the 14th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens
@cspanwj In their recent pro gay marriage decision, SCOTUS has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the United States Constitution.
@RushedLimbo you're literally incapable of intimidating me. anyways SCOTUS interprets the constitution. mar equality is the law of the land
@AlphaKruse @suz123nj @papalputz @OtterDose @MatStaver SCOTUS vitiated KY marriage law immediately b/c it violated 14th Amendment
@LarryOConnor @GretchenCarlson U sound like the hated "smartset" now? Is #KimDavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from SCOTUS in history?

The what's a better show debate, Seinfeld vs Friends is one for the ages but you may be mentally incompetent if you think Friends is better.
About to see Ant Man... I don't expect it to be as good as A Bug's Life, Antz, or Seinfeld's "the Bee Movie"... But I may BEE surprised
My sick day has consisted of watching Seinfeld and Facetiming and it may be the best day I've had all summer.
Nothing like a rainy Sunday with coffee, Seinfeld reruns and the right amount of laziness.

@Morning_Joe I haven't laughed this hard on a Thur night since Seinfeld ended. Not the last episode though, that one was terrible.
Nothing like watching episodes of Seinfeld on a Sunday morning.Seen all but the humorous slant is different each time. Magic @JerrySeinfeld
I told someone about how I once sat on the floor of my hotel room and watched Seinfeld for hours and they threatened to punch me.
Will watch old movies, Seinfeld and other silly things till Sunday...the old #katrina news footage is too much for this heart to bear.
I just bought tickets to see Seinfeld in Durham next month. What a great Tuesday!
George's stories may be my favorite thing about Seinfeld - he is so passionate it's wonderful
@KaineofTermina So that's a yes and a maybe for this reference. I'm not sure if anyone got the Seinfeld reference Wednesday.
@morganameridius @disquietus now back in the day I watched a good bit. Friends, Seinfeld, 3rd Rock, 70s show. But as I got older not much
@sethhinz haha! Seriously, though, it reminds me of the Seinfeld character Jimmy. "Jimmy liked worship this Sunday."  #chsocm
I'm pretty sure Serena ripped that match winning ace the same time USMNT game up their 3rd.

I hope every young girl watched the Williams sisters tonight. Serena may have won but they'll go down as the greatest sibling duo ever!
Serena is emotionally drained. Hope she has time to rest up before Thursday.
Serena be lettin oponents comeback in the 2nd set just to make the media feel better. That good #SerenaVsVenus
Serena may have taken that match, but Venus wins.  So much class.  Just a good person. The same cannot be said about her sister.  #veealways
Serena won. The Cubs are winning in St. Louis. I'm enjoying sports lately. Too bad the Bears play this Sunday.
Serena dominated in the end, a tough match for the win! https://t.co/QHjXSFz4Bi
Know what's scary? Serena was mildly injured a little after Wimbledon and sat out before the US Open.  She could win with that formula.
Now that I've calmed down after watching Serena.... Do you realize how great tomorrow's Vika-Simona match is gonna be??
Couldn't hang on to stay up and watch 3rd set but it was nice to see Serena beat Venus. What a resilient, tough player Venus is, tho.
Going to the U.S. Open on Thursday so I hope Serena wins tonight
I really hope that Obama attends Serena's match on Saturday...Ciara's doing the National Anthem. Give us deze ratings biches.

Everyone should most definitely not go watch Star Wars on December 18th because it'll be a terrible movie
@tokyofox not about that but there'll be many more things you'll get excited about Star Wars coming out in Japan before Dec 18.
I haven't told anyone but I bought about $30 in Star Wars merch on force Friday and I'm proud of it
Chris just said he likes Star Wars more than me. If I wasn't so relaxed that may have been a big argument haha

@OsoFreshFutbol I think the expectations are so low in Avatar land it may be a sleeper. Star Wars land is going to be tough to do right.
#ForceFriday as a whole was pretty disappointing. Not sure who dropped the ball - retailers, Hasbro, or Disney. It's Star Wars! C'mon!
@ImBoardWithLife @ChrisBryanGames what Star Wars game released on Force Friday are you most interested in?
@alexkidwell I give zero shits about Star Wars, and I'm only mildly excited by Bond films. Will I be seeing you on RHAP tomorrow?!
there's not really anyone I know irl that gets passionate enough about Star Wars I need to find new friends before dec 18th
Just discovered the complete first season of Star Wars rebels is available for free On Demand. Tomorrow's work day just got AWESOME.
@rebelrealcanon Nothing wrong with that. I was in 4th grade when Episode I was released. I'd seen the OT before, but TPM is my Star Wars!

@KevinLive5 thanks! I know you would have the answer. Hope all is well! I'm sure Sting last Monday had you jacked up with energy!
HERE WE GO Monday Night Raw hopefully we get another good show tonight Sting vs Rollins at NOC should be really good #RAW
What a good way to open Monday Night Raw with Sting, lovin it! #RAW #WWE
#StingonRaw what a great way to start off Monday night Raw with Sting!
He may be 56, but Sting is still as passionate as ever and still has the fire. Still awesome on the mic. He and Rollins will be M-O-N-E-Y.

"Don't worry. You may think you'll never get over it, but you also thought it would last forever." - Taylor Swift
Just close your eyes, the sun is going down. You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now. - Taylor Swift
Not entirely sure that I remembered deodorant but Taylor Swift is tomorrow so it's like it doesn't even matter what else happens.

Tiger Woods was 2 behind leader, Jason Gore, after the 3rd rnd but is in a strong position http://t.co/43ouISCIbP http://t.co/SZJlFjfS1a
Is Tiger Woods form finally returning or is it a one off. Unlucky lip out on 18th but an aggressive putt.
Not sure I wanted Tiger Woods to win a golf tournament more than I do today. Swallowed the pride, showed up and delivered. C'mon big cat!

@pecunium Edge of Tomorrow was Yet Another Tom Cruise Movie, which is to say it was too long, blew up too much shit, &amp; needed a better end.
I may not be the biggest Ron Howard / Tom Cruise fan, but boy do I love Far and Away http://t.co/AebFh1YSdq
may i just say that Tom Cruise looks hot as fuck in a navy blue suit
Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise is another bad ass movie; I have never seen it till now.
I'm not huge fan of Tom Cruise but much like the last movie I saw him in, Edge of Tomorrow, #MissionImpossibleRogueNation was really good.
@nuahs6881 You mean Edge of Tomorrow? It is surprisingly wonderful and I wound up feeling about Tom Cruise the way I did as a kid after
good things i saw on the way to work: - car w picture of tom cruise in the 1st mission: impossible movie - "TUSHI DR" license plate

@eazyrooster @ditchell I loved tom cruise in Tropic Thunder and that's pretty much it. But I heard Edge of Tomorrow was great.
Just watched "Edge of Tomorrow" and liked it. Mostly because Tom Cruise died a hundred times.
@Aellis994 edge of tomorrow is a well good film! Didn't know he directed that aswell. Im just gonna ignore the critisisms of Tom Cruise
The "Edge of Tomorrow" ad campaign really should've been more focused on the promise of getting to watch Tom Cruise die over and over again.
I did need to check to make sure this wasn't a junior Tory minister I'd never heard of. http://t.co/ojZmIfSjje

Tory concerned about carding black kids and the traffic on the Gardiner.He'll speak to the press Wednesday about the Gardiner.
Theresa May is the Tory leader Labour should fear http://t.co/M0CBiPbq1R
I'm glad the Tories won the General Election in May. They're showing just how insensitive they really are Vote Tory. They do not give a Fuck
daphne_miles @LabourEoin @juliehunt1953 Yes - I am afraid you may - we are reminded- the Tory government as heartless then as now!
So Cameron has lost Telegraph and The Sun over #refugeecrisis. So who supports him? Do Tory right really want drowned children on beaches?
The grassroots response to the refugee crisis should shame the Tory government. http://t.co/nGPCFwPigl
No point asking for humanity from a Tory. Pretty sure they are all replicants created by the Nazis after WWII. Especially Theresa May.

Trump also plans to be in DC tomorrow.  Watch him on O'Rilley 's show tonight and was great Loved what he had 2 say  https://t.co/Ry83BvsEtV
Jeb is an odd choice for a debut show. Trump would have been the only candidate to have on his 1st show. #colbertlateshow
@MrMediaTraining Jeb! should be very happy. Colbert may be the one person who can reduce the Trump farce to size. He may diminish him.
Trump says Iran deal forces U.S. to defend Iran if it's attacked by Israel http://t.co/GtWegIgJOM via @PolitiFactVA FALSE
First Colbert Show tonight. Jeb on. Sanders on Thursday. Trump on Fallon Friday. Should all be good for a few chuckles.
@DJFunkyGrrL Just because his hired manager may have been racist doesn't mean Trump had anything to do with it.
unfortunately it looks like Trump may not be the answer. HIS answer regarding allowing Syrian refugees here was not good.
I wonder does Trump know, make America great again was the Klan's 1st slogan? https://t.co/qrFMt4MbWV

Tsipras resigned on Thursday night after he lost the support from within his Syriza party. That is classic #Grexit.
@ekathimerini Far Left has used and uses Tsipras as a wheelbarrow to the microphones, as #Tsipras used #ND and #PASOK before January 25.

Castle crashers free for Xbox one. Tomorrow!! Only  for those who owns the game on Xbox  360.  I'm ready for this! http://t.co/CvcNflakM2
@BenAves @lukepatterson90 Ryan kindly gave me a month free trial code. Gonna renew it when my Xbox lives needs renewing... On the 12th
I'm proud of what my Xbox live Gamertag is going to be tomorrow. Me and my friends just thought of it.
Friday is about to be such a great day frist day on my new Xbox one
Need a person with a 2box / 2nd Xbox. Will get free EB
@SoaRRolex make sure u get your 2nd Xbox and get  BIGG TERRY on there to setup for us
@SegmentNext I got an xbox one on the 7th of April this year and it looks good for zombie games
@tamaki_ebooks well I'm getting an Xbox one on the 18th so don't worry, I'll be able to talk about it soon. I just don't know if I wanna-

@Thefly3st @ctparker910 good marketing plays a part in all that too, and yes for now it is, come november xbox wins, we getting windows 10
Can't wait to see the @ChelseaFC blues and that dude Zlatan on Saturday. I mean @TooIaZy
@hello_noto01 Zlatan!  Cavani has been unhappy about playing 2nd fiddle to Ibrahimovic... He's signing a new contract! Zlatan to MUFC?
LOL Aulas still mad about the penalty Zlatan took a 2nd time a few month ago. I'm delighted by the fact that he is still butt-hurt about it!
We are certainly gonna see Verratti in the 2nd half. I'm like a kid waiting for his present ;-) Oh &amp; Zlatan starts so thats great. #PSGFIO
Zlatan is still a beast. If he's replacing RvP then it's good business  https://t.co/M2IZ9Vv5KG
If Alexandre Lacazette does move to PSG does that mean that a Zlatan transfer may be in the making? #Ibrahimovic #soccer #futbol
@DanSanders123 @MoneyMitch624 @BleacherReport @espn HA I just saw this.. Made my Sunday.. Also Zlatan is really good at soccer Norris
So, about Zlatan... I don't want him. All reports are that he's not a good teammate. He'd be our 3rd DP Fwd, how do you work the 3 together?
Our squad right now is good enough to challenge for the 3rd place, but if we sign Romagnoli, Witsel and Zlatan, i see us title condenders
I would love to have cavani man. He's over shawdowed and played 2nd fiddle to Zlatan he would shine at arsenal
@dani_pitter I mean I get the hype around JLaw. I may not like her but I get her hype. I just don't understand Amy Schumer and her hype
I just think that sports are stupid &amp;anyone who likes them is a lesser person &amp; has a small intellect- Amy Schumer https://t.co/fdjWKKG5AR
"If you do like Amy Schumer, I hope you went &amp; saw her Saturday bc after this ridiculousness, I highly doubt Maine will be on list of faves."
They may be mean but I guess they're not stupid...free TED but you have to pay for Amy Schumer - most unimpressed. https://t.co/BrdeiudNJd

I just want it to be Saturday so Amy Schumer can make me laugh and feel good about my life compared to hers.
"I'm just really excited for my comedy filled day tomorrow... Amy Schumer live AND John Mulaney on Netflix?! Thank you, America."
Inside Amy Schumer is scorching its merry way back onto @ComedyCentralUK in the new year. S3 begins on Jan 11 at 11pm. (S2 still on demand.)
Kind of equally excited at staying in watching The Soup finale tonight as I am for going out to see Amy Schumer tomorrow. Well...kind of
"One of the 1st jokes from the hilarious Amy Schumer at @TWCArena: ""If anybody thought they were seeing 'Godspell' tonight, maybe exit left."""
Some may find it tragic that I'm sat alone watching Amy Schumer and eating Ben and Jerries but personally I feel no shame
"Watching 'Inside Amy Schumer' for the 1st time. She's funny, sassy, smart, beautiful...&amp; sleeps with a teddy bear in one sketch. I'm hooked."
Watching Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo makes me so excited for Sunday when @KentStateUSG brings @amyschumer
"When it comes to body empowerment and feeling comfortable in your own skin, Amy Schumer is the role model we look up to. On Thursday"
"in them to do it.  Amy Schumer in EW, October @amyschumer is a fucking rock star &amp; I love her &amp; Jesus F'ing Christ we need more like this"

As ridiculous as Ant-Man may have looked it was actually pretty damn good #bigfan
"Sorry gang, 2nd Act of Ant-Man just kills my buzz. SO BORING and the writing is REALLY bad. I'm hoping this stuff wasn't in Wright's script."

Ant-Man at AMC Cinema Suites on a Sunday afternoon is a great choice. Good film. Have to see it again cause missed @HayleyAtwell's scene
"Ant-Man felt like the 1st IronMan movie 2 me. That's good. It did feel like 2 films grafted onto each other. Not as good, but not bad either"
"Ant-Man is important. No matter how small his role in Civil War may actually be, he is still there for a reason. Don't downplay him."

"Seeing Ant-Man on monday, finally. 9pm showing, so i'll be useless the next day. And I don't care."
"Seeing Ant-Man tomorrow, flat, it just isn't worth $40 *more* to see it in 3D. We'll just have to use our imaginations."
Shoutout to @bthousto for going with me to see Ant-Man (highly recommend) and scoring us free ice cream yesterday. Best 2nd to last day here
Somehow I was able to enjoy the 2nd half of Ant-Man in spite of my gleeful anticipation about all the Ant-Lamb jokes I couldn't wait to make
"Sure, ANT-MAN is a cool film, but make sure you know all your movie options. ... (Vine by SATURDAY NIGHT VINE) https://t.co/DyXAETE6Vt"

@castlescrumbln A response to Bad Blood may make the album ugly.
Bad Blood is such a terrible fucking song. I just listened to it for the 1st time and I feel like God took a shit in my ears
Discussing the T Swift vs K Perry feud with boyf (he was unaware). He's a big fan of both. He says he's torn. May have to boycott Bad Blood.
Listening to Bad Blood on the radio 1st time: this is awful 8: people like this? 15: that bass line isn't so bad  Now: NOW WE GOT BAD BLOOD
"@taylornation13 I love Taylor Swift I'm going to her concert on September 13, I love all of her songs especially  Bad Blood she is my idol!"
Bad Blood by Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift may be my guilty pleasure of the year. I wish more mainstream pop was like this.
"Honestly, I'm liking Kendrick's ""Bad Blood"" verses a lot more now. May be able to elevate the song to being really good to me."
"I love ""Bad Blood"" and I love the music video, but it is just Taylor acting a damn fool. Like c'mon."
"Jess Glynne has a song called ""Bad Blood"" on her new album &amp; I'm seeing her in November &amp; I hope she does a BB/BB Remix."
"Seeing @tenthavenorth tomorrow at LifeLight! Hoping a cover of ""Bad Blood"" is included in the set list!"
Short drive to work this morning with Bad Blood--Raspberry Beret--Out of Style as my soundtrack.  Tuesday gonna be a good day.
Someone hangout with me tomorrow so I can show them the dance I made to Bad Blood. It's pretty fucking sick.
"Taylor is going to dominate when the nominations for the VMAs are released tomorrow, Blank Space and Bad Blood were very well made videos."

Surprising end to a Gauntlet Match between Brock Lesnar and the three weakest members of the RAW Roster in WWE 2k14. He lost to the 2nd man.
@AstrosCounty I hope he's ready for Brock Lesnar on Sunday.
@jamiestar1986 Monday night raw should be good tonight I wonder will sting show up or if Brock Lesnar will be there
"@xavjos89 Your also a WWE Pro Wrestling Fan? I hope we the ""Feud"" between The Undertaker vs Brock Lesnar is over after Sun ""Summerslam""?"
Are you guys ready for Brock Lesnar to return on Monday Night Raw?!?! Too bad I already wore his shirt last Monday. I gotta wash it soon.
Brock Lesnar vs The Undertaker match next Sunday is going to be great.
Brock Lesnar will be facing the Undertaker on august 23 make sure not to miss all you WWE fans out there.It could be the best match ever!!
Cringed a few times during that interview on @espn felt bad for Brock Lesnar. Summerslam is this Sunday by the way
I feel like Brock Lesnar may be the only boyfriend that's safe dating Rousey.
I hope the Oct 3 special from Madison Square Garden (feat. Brock Lesnar) is broadcast on the Network... 'cause this guy has ringside seats.
"I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/3M4inyoqIy WWE RAW, Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman addressed the ending of SummerSlam, Aug 24,"
"I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/JNs5uMGHLX Relive the buildup to Brock Lesnar's clash against Roman Reigns: SmackDown, March 26,"
Very excited for @WWE #SummerSlam paperview this Sunday. Man I really hope the Undertaker tombstones Brock Lesnar back to the UFC
"WWE in Brock Lesnar's territory of Minneapolis, Minnesota! and fittingly #lesnarvstaker on Monday Night RAW. I love it! #SummerSlam"
What chaos between Brock Lesnar and Undertaker on Monday night Raw loved it can't wait for SummerSlam http://t.co/UAViO8gj99

I like it when a celebrity that's crap at cooking goes on Saturday Kitchen. Chris Evans looks like he's never used a whisk in his life.
Is the Chris Evans show really bad this morning or is it Monday morning blues?
TFI Friday was good in the 90s because it was new and Chris Evans was young.  Someone needs to tell him this is crap and dated.
Watching TFI Friday/The Chris Evans Show:D Nothing like it used to be. Talk about painful to watch. Some things are best left in the past.
"Well done Chris Evans, I did not think it was possible to make TFI Friday any more shit than it used to be, but you have proved me wrong"

The reason TFI isn't as good now is cos the 1st time around Chris Evans was on the verge of a breakdown and it was incredible watching him
Top Gear returns on 8th May! Yes it's Chris Evans and there will be 16 episodes. Clarkson's Amazon effort will be great as well.

Had a great time in Bloodborne today. Thank you to all the followers and subs!! Cya tomorrow for Dark Souls 1 and 2 NG-NG+99 progress!!!
I have a lot of plans for my day tomorrow. And by that I mean I'm going to accidentally play Dark Souls for 5 hours. &amp; still whine about it.
It's Saturday night &amp; @RetroGaijin is playing Dark Souls! He has a face only you could love https://t.co/omwtJOpIgU https://t.co/gXavwfExCx
Never been more proud of my non gaming girlfriend than when she beat the Asylum Demon on Dark Souls on her 2nd attempt!
Project in March or whenever the fuck I feel like I should playing Dark Souls and focus.
Seeing the positive comments about Bloodborne's DLC has me even more excited for my Dark Souls series playthrough in January.
Thanks everyone who came and hung out through the challenge! Tomorrow I'm starting my first full playthrough of Dark Souls!
"Was reading Dark Souls 3 may be last Souls game.  That'd be good.  Keep it special, you know?"
Wednesday I will make sure to be fully awake for Dark Souls and will likely got for a couple of hours instead of my normal 2
Wow strong 20 hour cast of Dark Souls. The zwei addiction is real! I'll be back at it tomorrow evening probably after another DaS dream lol
sick Dark Souls 2 stream action was had! Abledorfenheim.. the legend. we shall continue tomorrow!
I'm a fan of some really weird music but the new David Bowie may be the strangest I've ever heard. Not even sure what I just saw
"Any conference where the first speaker is named David Bowie can't be a bad one. (No, he's obv not that Bowie). https://t.co/epR3Iv5h0e"
Be sure to tune in Thursday's 2-4 pm for a brand new show with @MikeyTrapasso @Dwellbush and yes I'm bringing David Bowie checkpoint with me
"Buenos Jueves , good thursday with David Bowie thursday childhttps://youtu.be/rV29uzF_RSg https://t.co/LzgCrWAbeY"
Can't wait for January 8 so I could lock myself in a dark room&amp;listen to the entirety of blackstar.Weird David Bowie music is the best music
David Bowie just shared the first song/video from his upcoming January release. We are left intrigued and... https://t.co/hTtSeyTqCG
David Bowie makes me want to draw and draw and get lost in a whirlwind of sound and color :D #Saturday #BoxingDay #drawing #DavidBowie
"David Bowie's 'Blackstar' video https://t.co/z7T1iJZnh4 Strange, dark, and beautiful. I think I love it. New album arrives in January."
David Bowie's new 10-minute epic just released from his new album out in January. Middle bit is vintage weird Bowie. https://t.co/J7CYVNamHO
Does anyone know if Blackstar from David Bowie will be downloadable as a single or do we have to wait for the full album in Jan?
"In other news, had a great Saturday on the town with @kyotas_papillon and my old uni friend at a David Bowie tribute orchestra :P"
"Morning Sunday lovers. In the words of David Bowie - I'm happy, hope you're happy too :) x"
New David Bowie single from the soon to be released BLACK STAR. Hey! I can't fuckin' wait(January 8th). Enjoy!... https://t.co/zlXH2ih5Cy
"New David Bowie tune to start Friday and its ten minutes long, good work David. A tour announcement now would make today perfect #Blackstar"
Only good thing going right now is my David Bowie raccoon hat comes in on Saturday
Those of you who hang on my every word with regards musical recommendations may be interested to know that I like the new David Bowie track.
"i did not think about david bowie very much today. tomorrow will be different, i promise"
"i have the privilege of performing at the usher hall tomorrow, which seats 2,200 &amp; has welcomed elton john, led zeppelin &amp; david bowie..."
David Price does not look happy getting sent off. He's allowed a hit each inning and left the game with the tying run at 2nd.
"David Price lost a late lead against the Yankees in Friday's 4-3 defeat, allowing three runs on 11 hits over 7 1/3 innings."
Lets kill David Price tomorrow like we always do and maybe you all will calm the fuck down #Yankees
6th strike out by David Price. Love the calm &amp; trust from our pitcher #BlueJays
@BlueJays win. Count em down boys 3.5 games back. 2 more big ones this weekend with the big guy David Price throwing tomorrow
"@KD9512 the great Troy Tulowitzki, the great David Price going Friday."
"@NJD107 Can't wait for this weekend, especially Saturday when my guy David Price is on the mound. I love that team."
@bluejays David Price getting you excited to watch the Jays play again. #11ks #wins October baseball? https://t.co/l0YYWZZ8nr
@smackalalala Currently 6-0 Top of the 9th. They got lucky trading for David Price.  That's one ace of a pitcher to have in the lineup.
As good as David Price would have been imagine what the Yankees may have in Severino for the next 15-20 seasons... wow
But here's the good news: - Tomorrow is a new game  - 0.5 back is nothing - DAVID PRICE IS STILL A TORONTO BLUE JAY
"David Price felt good even into 8th inning. Then it snowballed. ""That's baseball, that's part of it and if you don't like it, pitch better."""
David Price going tomorrow for a franchise win record? Sounds good.
David Price is lucky so far...nowhere near the same guy as last Saturday
David Price still out in the 8th ? Gonna love this guy. #Bluejays #ComeTogether
"David Price will take the mound Friday night, his first road start as a Blue Jay. Yes, life is very good in Toronto. #BlueJays."
"Elvis's .455 (15-33) career batting average versus David Price ranks 2nd best among 43 pitchers against which he has had 20+ PA (C.C., .481)"
I don't get the panic at all. Still in playoffs still david price pitching Friday still great lineup still lots of games left #bluejays
"I'm going to an Angels game tomorrow, but I'm not a fan. It's a great thing David Price is pitching tho!!!"
It's a good feeling when you're getting killed but realize you'll finish today in first place and have David Price pitching tomorrow
People worried about david price pitching tomorrow but they seem to forget we own the guy #NYY
Selfishly need a good Hutch outing. Anything less may mess with rotation &amp; the perfectly planned-out David Price start in LA next Friday.
That's right it is Thursday night. Come to Boots &amp; Slurs and let David Price and Hollie King make you favorite... http://t.co/Cgyxhq2qmK
"Tomorrow, David Price takes the mound. That is nice."
Tons of preseason football and an important jays game with David price on the mound. Ideal friday
Very exciting. Love David Price and he is going to love CRazy Corn. Go Jays Go!!! https://t.co/YnT5VpLr9I
What's a better way to end off the August long than David Price's 8IP 11k's?  SCRUFFY MURPHY'S TRIVIA TONIGHT 9pm ;)  Gonna be a great show
david price is a blue jay and the blue jays are in a playoff spot in august. im extremely happy with the way things are right now
david price pitches for the toronto blue jays tomorrow #encore
"your right David Price win tomorrow, I hope we win. I just prayed my rosary. soo i still believe in you Jays. go jay https://t.co/QXAf3RDYbc"
#Nationals #mlb David Wright returns to the Mets Monday night. That's not necessarily a good thing. http://t.co/KAKwCBm2sw
I really hope David Wright doesn't kill the Mets flow when he comes back tomorrow. I think we're doing great without him
"#REVIEW #Phillies @ #Mets B2-1o: Phillies challenged (play at 1st), call on the field was #overturned: David Wright grounds out,... [1/2]"
"@J_Ko__ Really! So lucky, Matt Harvey is pitching, it's David Wright's 1st home game since coming off the disabled list!"
"@maggie162 @tpgMets @MarkHimmelstein I mean, apparently he was the guy who got the Mets hooked on the very cookies David Wright served Tues."
David Wright comes back to a Mets team in 1st with a 5 game lead snd we're whute hot. I haven't been this excited foe baseball in forever
David Wright coming back tomorrow highly increases the chances of me putting up an MCM Instagram. Not even a little bit ashamed.
David Wright def got his groove back on defense after a rough 1st couple games right after he returned. The Captain's looking great! #Mets
David Wright goes down swinging on fourth AB. Had a couple nice looks. Just couldn't connect. He's at third to start the 8th. #Mets
"David Wright may not hit another HR for 3 weeks, if we're being totally serious here. But good for him tonight."
"David Wright maybe returning in Philly, you say? Makes me even more excited for my trip there next Tuesday..."
David Wright returns to the 1st place @Mets tomorrow. Life is good.
Going to be such a nice sight to see David Wright standing at 3rd base tonight.
"I may regret this later in the season, but I'm so happy for David Wright."
In his first AB since 4/14 David Wright sent a pitch into the 2nd row of the 2nd deck in left. Would love him if he wasn't a Met.
It's good to see my man David Wright back in the lineup... Time to be a captain and lead us deep into October #mets #LGM
Mets 3B David Wright crushed the ball deep to left on the third pitch of his 1st at-bat
"Monday was a great sign for David Wright. But if he stumbles, he's willing to take a backseat: http://t.co/Z7okgykZ2O http://t.co/VOqkrYDs7G"
My daughter begged me to take her to David Wright's 1st game back in Philly. Guess I look like quite the bad Dad now. Mets have 7 HR inc DW
So happy David Wright is coming back tomorrow!!! Hopefully he an stay off the DL. Another big bat in the lineup!!! #WrightTime #LGM

I hate myself for doing this. Happy last day at Dunkin tomorrow. May I never have to make a rude bitches coffee again http://t.co/fxfDzctIn5
So I was at Dunkin and this idiot messed up my order 4 times then he said he wasn't giving me my order the 5th like what the hell he stupid.
"Tried Dunkin's Oreo iced coffee &amp; it's not as good as it *could* be. Then again, I may have too high of hopes for cookie-flavored coffee."
What's the requirement to work at Dunkin? Complete up to 8th grade? Reasons I hate going there. No people skills.
sad that my dunkin won't have pumpkin coffee till the 29th
"@AlexRea98 tomorrow morning before work I'm getting pumpkin coffee from Dunkin, if there isn't any, you're responsible"
@BaileyPerez dont worry! We can stop at dunkin tomorrow and the coffee will wake ya right up shorty!
"@BrooksCraven I would cry so much.. I'm waiting to dunk in Sept with friends. Our theme is ""dunkin ugly. because who dunks pretty? not 16"""
@Taybay_2012 wouldn't it be great if there was someone to bring us Dunkin tomorrow  (cough) @NikMoore_
"@haysnyder1212 don't worry bro, I'm going to get coffee alone tomorrow. Dunkin hotties may be there"
@karaakline but then I have to leave the house early to get dunkin and I've already accepted the fact that I'm going to be late tomorrow
@teamgabrod I like pumpkin muffins from Dunkin!  Would Thursday or Friday be good for you??
A little old man at Dunkin donuts told me I was beautiful. With the Monday I've had...i needed that.
As long as I get Dunkin tomorrow morning I should be good for the school day
Dunkin &amp; Buffy the vampire slayer with @fernnr5 I think today is going to be a good Saturday.
Dunkin is the most important one so go there first  https://t.co/M9ag4L8utq

Free iced coffee Monday at Dunkin and pumpkin spice is back... This basic girl is so excited that I just got a coffee at 8pm
I hope I can go to dunkin tomorrow bc it's the only thing that'll keep me awake/alive
"I know it's just preseason but do I still get free Dunkin tomorrow, or nahhhh?"
I try to always pay for the order behind me at Dunkin on Monday's..starts both of our weeks off on a good note.
"I want Dunkin so bad, I don't think I can wait until tomorrow."
If anyone is stopping at Dunkin and would be so kind to get me a coffee I'll pay you back tomorrow so hit me up! Thanks!!!
If someone wants to bring me Dunkin tomorrow that would make me happy
"Just got a large iced coffee from Dunkin, which is my 6th cup of coffee (so far) today. Do you think that's bad?"
May or may not be addicted to the cold apple cider from Dunkin
My 9-5 job is ACTUALLY 9-5 now! I will celebrate with Dunkin' Donuts tomorrow.. You're welcome for the free advertising btw @Reno_Dunkin
So glad tomorrow's my last day at Dunkin
"The fact that Bailey is bringing Dunkin into work tomorrow, is the only thing keeping me motivated to wake up in the morning."
The only good thing about today was the guy at dunkin telling me this morning that they'd have pumpkin coffee tomorrow...
This morning there was no traffic and the person in front of me at dunkin paid for my drink :) happy friday!!
Very excited about this Tuesday night @MotorCycleNight free iced coffee and smoothies courtesy of Dunkin' Donuts will be there set up.
When Dunkin' Donuts actually get your order right on a Saturday morning you know it's going to be a good day
When you're really excited that the boss is buying you Dunkin after a long Friday .... @AlexxPariseau http://t.co/TQVTYs2AM9
"With the sun on your face, Dunkin, Anna Karenina &amp; the music of @StevieNicks how could anyone be in a bad mood? #relaxation #selfcare"
"You know it's been a great weekend when you spend  $50 in dunkin donuts on fri, sat, and sunday."
if anyone is going to dunkin tomorrow morning and is just feelin real generous my order is a medium chips ahoy iced coffee w cream&amp;sugar:-)
if anyone wants to surprise me with a mocha iced coffee from Dunkin tomorrow that'd be cool
"somehow managed to lock my keys in the car this morning at Dunkin, happy Friday :-)"
the best part about the Cubs winning is the free coffee at dunkin tomorrow
"this adorable old couple in dunkin literally made my day, he's turning 89 tomorrow and talked to me about how he was drafted for the WWII"
"Dustin Johnson having a complete meltdown on the 1st hole, on the green in 6 or 7 I've lost count. #PGAChampionship"
Dustin Johnson just took an 8 on the 1st hole. I don't feel so bad about my golf game suddenly. #PGAChampionship #snowman
Just pulled a Dustin Johnson on the 18th at Castle Creek and don't know if I've ever been this depressed
"R&amp;A's handling of the end of round 2 was diabolical. I watched Spieth, Matsuyama and Dustin Johnson early Saturday, very unfair on them."
@Brucehillbhoy up there with him and dustin Johnson and I love to see there pain on a Sunday
"@JamesFenn90 Like you say, Rory, Spieth, Rose and Day should be great to watch. If Dustin Johnson can get his head together he may join them"
@Tyler_Tremelle was angry at me after Friday because Dustin Johnson was outperforming Jordan Spieth. He's now quite happy with me.
@_andrewclarke: Dustin Johnson good 1st day again. Deja vu on him flopping next few days.
Dustin Johnson again proves he may be best golfer on the planet on Thursday Friday and Saturday... just not good when matters most. #Sunday.
Dustin Johnson has a great chance to win the @PGAChampionship as long as there is no Sunday round. @DJohnsonPGA
Dustin Johnson is leading the PGA but don't worry. Saturday is only 2 days away
"Dustin Johnson makes an eagle on 16 to move to -13. He may not have a major, but boy is he wonderful to watch when on song. #USPGA"
"Dustin Johnson may wind up being another in the long list of athletes with ""million dollar arm and five cent head"" ... hope not"
"Dustin Johnson rolls to a Thursday clubhouse lead in a major, of course: Perhaps it's a good thing Dustin John... http://t.co/5wBjjjeb6f"
"Dustin Johnson sure knows how to get an early lead on Thursday, he just can't hang on to that lead on Sunday"
"He's a very fast starter in the first round in Majors, but will Dustin Johnson strike it third time lucky come Sunday? #Majors #golfchat"
It's Thursday and Dustin Johnson is crushing it at a major. All is right.
"Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson in 2nd, it's a good day"
Next time Dustin Johnson tees off on a Sunday in contention in a Major want him decked out in Godolphin blue #uspga
No surprise: Dustin Johnson had a strong 1st rd Thursday at PGA Championship. Can he sustain it through weekend? http://t.co/goOqMTpsuy
Not sure I could muster the mental strength to play 17 more holes after  doing what Dustin Johnson just did on the 1st. #PGAChampionship
"Of all the things I'm envious of when it comes to professional golfers, Dustin Johnson's strut walk may be at the top of the list."
Really hope Dustin Johnson pulls it out the bag tomorrow and ties up #TheOpen  #Adidas #AdidasGolf
"The 10th hole seems to be a good birdie hole. Dustin Johnson birdies the 10th, his 1st hole to move to -1 #PGAChamp"
Well I pulled a Dustin Johnson on the 18th but I'm proud to say I played the best 9 holes of my life tonight #GoLow http://t.co/zBZR1EfiZC

"Fuck wit Dre Day was really a terrible song. Ice Cube wrecked that beat though on ""Friday"" (the song)."
"@TIME   Suge is right, that movie is exaggerated. It's almost like Ice Cube wrote the screenplay, just like he wrote Friday by himself."
Have you ever sat back and thought why people accepted the name Ice Cube as a reputable rap name?
Need a Friday marathon one of these weekends. Just laugh while Ice Cube's belly gradually grows and his mean mug gets meaner with each movie
"So, bone to pick with #HigherLearning - Ice Cube is a 6th year senior, preaching race politics &amp; activism.  Yet is clearly a lazy rich kid."
"@NicAlmighty come on, you know most white people know about Friday. It was the only movie that I wasn't scared of Ice Cube."

"I loved the scene in #StraightOuttaCompton where Ice Cube was working on his screenplay for Friday. That was so inspiring, man."
I was watching Friday rn and Ice Cube uhh was pretty good looking if you ask me
"I'll use a more recent example. When was the last time you got excited about a ""new Ice Cube record?"" By most standards he may be top 25 OAT"
"Ice Cube has framed Craig as an attractive man with attractive love interests in every ""Friday"" movie."
Ice Cube managed to make all three Friday movies different but all still hilarious
Ice cube can produce some good movies. We just need another Friday
Ice cube made today was a good day. And wrote and starred in Friday. Today we bump cube.
"If nothing else, Straight Outta Compton was worth it just for Ice Cube laughing at his own script for Friday. Seriously, tho. Amazing film."
"Now that the world has accepted Ice Cube son, be on the look out for a Friday Prequel"
One thing though: when they show Ice Cube wiring the script for FRIDAY... that was inspiring as hell. A lot more tomorrow.

"I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/PCuHL1YzpE John Cena attacks Dolph Ziggler after his match with Randy Orton: SmackDown, Nov. 23,"
"I may pay for the WWE Network, that's how happy I am about John Cena getting owned by the Daily Show guy."
I'd love to be here and keep rolling on the floor laughing about John Cena... But my Driving Test is tomorrow so a WWE Network replay it is.
I'm sad about going into 6th year so I'm watching John Cena videos and it's helping so much
John cena love you ask a question you will be Monday in wwe ??
Legitimately crying at the KSU football hype video that transitions directly from John Cena's theme to that sad Friday Night Lights music
News in on John Cena possibility hurt at a live event.. Looks like he may have re-injured his nose. Hopefully the rumor is false #wwe #Cena
Not sure if I should keep going or just go home and get ready... FOR THIS SUNDAY NIGHT WITH JOHN CENA AT WWE SUUUUUPERSLAM
Pretty sure me and @WoahItsPaige99 had an obsession with John Cena in 5th grade #hipsters
So disappointed in wwe summerslam! I want to see john cena wins his 16th title
Start your Friday off the right way by watching John Cena save the day during an episode of Scooby Doo:  https://t.co/U7jQwSyWBB
"That John Cena prank call video may have taken a few years off of my life. I was laughing way too fucking hard, it was horrifying. #WWE"
Thinking I'm absolutely hilarious sat here playing the John Cena theme tune on a recorder
WWE Fans glad thank you @StephMcMahon @WWEUniverse  Sting vs. Seth Rollins John Cena vs. Seth Rollins  Good Luck Sunday Sept 20!
"Was challenged to ""name the wrestler"" on quizup and I read it as ""weather"". was very confuse when the 1st quest included a pic of John Cena"
Which is more important @WWE John cena's 16th title reign to tie or number 17 to break the record
"john cena ,if ua good u will beat john cena for the 1st round BUT FORGET ABT THE 2ND ROUND WE DONT GIVE UP. https://t.co/Eh0AOnKPzu"
john cena may be injured so it may mean that seth rollins will not be defending his united states championship at night of champions
"Hey Bernie, be ready to be attacked by Chuck Toad tomorrow on MTP, and watch how he kisses John Kasich ass!"
John Kasich may is just Jeb Bush from the a different state. He's a mealy mouthed squish.  https://t.co/cDllS7Il9E
"N.H. poll: Trump still 1st, but the mentally unstable John Kasich jumps like a boss into 2nd place - http://t.co/CtAGXfRABn"
"This #GOP race is seriously getting out of hand. Who in the blue heck is John Kasich? Or red heck, as the case may be here."
"Who the heck did John Kasich pay to get all this good post-debate pub?  Who is he? Oh right, and the debate was in Cleveland.   But c'mon"
"Ya know, John Kasich actually seems like a real human being with a real record.. Too bad that may or may not mean anything"
You worry about your 2nd amendment america with a nra nut john kasich givin guns like candy its my life i worry about.. wild west mentality.
John Kasich is crushing it tonight. He'll see a huge bump tomorrow. - undecided Republican in Cleveland Ohio http://t.co/ukWhUdiV08
Did John Kasich stand out in GOP forum?: Kasich delivered clear performance at Monday's GOP forum. But with so... http://t.co/mywXfgd2pt
I have to admit John Kasich may be the most competent person on the stage...
It's of hilarious that one of the biggest ovations from Thursday was when John Kasich said he wouldn't disown his hypothetical gay son.
John Kasich has sure come out of nowhere. I'd give him the W tonight. Can't wait to watch the Democratic Party's first debate in October.
"John Kasich may not be terribly polished, but he's coming across as more comfortable and real than Jeb Bush. #GOPDebate"
John Kasich seems well balanced and sensible compared to the rest at Thursday night's debate. I say @JohnKasich won.
John Kasich should feel proud of his performance at the #GOPDebate Thursday night. He looked more presidential than the rest of the field.
"John Kasich with the goal posts gesture needs to be on front pages tomorrow. It's a gift. Make me proud, headline writers."
My hope for the two remaining empty podiums on Thursday is Chris Christie and John Kasich.
Bases-loaded for Josh Hamilton with 2 outs. Already has a homer in this game. 2nd homer here? It's a full moon. Why not?
"I really like the way Josh Hamilton is swinging  the bat. More bat speed. Even though he K'd in the 3rd, he made some violent swings"
"In good, non-Kris Bryant Is Dead news, Josh Hamilton just put the Rangers up 2-0 over the Giants in the 6th"
"Josh Hamilton may not be having a great year, but he's consistently delivered in crucial moments."
"Josh Hamilton's 5th home run of the season, a two-run homer, provided the Texas #Rangers with all the support they needed to win. #MLB"
So @aandro comes on #Rangers Insider and tells the listeners Josh Hamilton looked great in BP and then he hits a bomb in his 1st AB..Genius!
The Texas Rangers did a nice job today and Josh Hamilton is able to hit his 5th home run and he did a great job today.

"@guyfarmer1978 lol, true. The other striker you do have were trying to take off your hands by Tuesday, lol!! Kane has lost his confidence!"
"@ironviews Good article, and good point about Sakho. He could be sat here now in the same situation as Kane, with people starting to doubt."
"Okay so the White Sox suck, Rose and Kane may be sexual predators, and Cobb and Nelson are hurt before game one. Sports suck."
Same old same old good till the last 3rd no support for Kane no width fuck knows what Poch is doing ain't got a fucking clue
@BrendanWadlow still see Koivu. You even admitted it was a good comparison like a month back. Kane may be a better one though.

"GLEN HODDLE: Harry Kane's impact Friday was extraordinary. It was great to see Kane, the leading Premier League scorer, come on and score"
GOAL! Kane 1-0 England   His 3rd in 4 internationals. Shaw with a great pull back and Kane slams it home with his left.   #ENGvSWI
I am really hoping the #preds aren't one of the 5 teams that called about trading for Kane. Not sure we have enough room for 3rd chances.
"I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/aCZISHWQI0 Josh Mathews questions the look AJ gave Kane: Raw June 4,"
I think some spurs may just be 0 betraying the abilities of Charlie Austin. We need a different option upfront. Too much like Kane #THFC
"Kane finding form at the right time, ready to score twice against Sunderland on Sunday..."
Kane with a brilliant finish tonight as England win 2-0 . let's hope he takes his performance into the game on Sunday http://t.co/S6GPyhbC3N
"My son is walkin out with the ENG team tomorrow night,told him under no circumstances can he b holding hands with Kane,am I right 2 say that"
Pretty sure Kane will interfere on Sunday in the Taker/Lesnar match and Taker wins then they have a rubber match and Les nar wins.

@Phoenvvx sure. Even Kendrick lost it towards the end of his Black Friday freestyle ( and this isn't me hating).
Both dope songs but Kendrick has a message Future just goin dumb on auto tune  https://t.co/pqIhnFhFNR
Damn dawg you weak ass niggas are really berating Kendrick. https://t.co/svYNcP7SqN
Honestly only bad thing I can say about the Kendrick album were the roll out of singles and what ones were picked 1st
I'll hate on Kendrick all fucking day but that Black Friday freestyle is fucking legendary
Kendrick made sure iggy wasn't going to steal his bars when he snapped on Black Friday.
Kendrick's 2015 album may be important but it's not especially listenable. Future sounds like a guy playing with a microphone at Best Buy.
That August Alsina album is dope. Most artists' sophomore album isn't as good as the first (*cough* Kendrick *cough*) but this joint fire
"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think that ever since the Grammy's snubbed Kendrick the first time,they just throwing awards at him"
While we're on the topic.... J. Cole &gt; Kendrick   As far as Black Friday is concerned... Go debate ya fat aunt who only wears elastic pants
Yo it's been 2 and a half weeks since Kendrick's Black Friday dropped and I still haven't fully understood all his lyrics yet...
@ChuckAlabaster: I'm in love J. Cole Kendrick Lamar-Black Friday it's soo good. Tales of two cites with a Kendrick twist @firediscopanda9
@DeeIsaac_ love you too bro. Be safe on the road back home so we can see Kendrick tomorrow.
@Godforshort_ @HIFTBABG C'mon man don't get me wrong Cole had a great album but Kendrick gonna take it home
"@Seis_GoDeep Kendrick we love you  in Arkansas.Hope you success where ever you life may go.I hope it leads back toAr. But if not,u go get It"
@Uggglyy @GirlsLuvDeonte Kendrick did his beat better than he did hahaha Coles Black Friday was weak sauce
@jacari_th3g0d You're right Drake is a rookie while Kendrick is an all star doing Michael Jordan numbers while Drake is 15th man of the year
"@jwilds41 &amp; what if by g eazy, and  black Friday by Kendrick, and dark time the weeknd"
@kev_tee23 @GeezMariee fuck just take her to the Compton swamp meet and may get lucky and run into Kendrick
Black Friday by J. Cole and Kendrick is soooo good and the ending of J. coles version had me dead

I know yall listened to Kendrick x Black Friday. So tell me with a straight face J Cole just as good @SameolDuece @Jarrick3Real @Young_Twaun
I love Kendrick's 2nd album as much as anyone but it doesn't compare to Good Kid Mad City
"I love refinding amazing songs. In 9th grade( now im a junior) i loved SOO many amazing rap songs like Memories back then with Kendrick, bob"
"I may need to fact check, but I'm pretty sure that Kendrick is only the 2nd rapper to have his 1st 2 albums nominated for AOTY."
"I purchase Kendrick, Cole, August, Lito, Drake etc. they give you records that mean something, that relate to life"
I'm pretty sad that this is the first time I've heard Black Friday by Kendrick and J.cole
"I've been listening to J Cole's and Kendrick's Black Friday.I mean even if it isn't a collaborative project, let the niggas drop some fire."
If Kendrick and Cole drop they're album in February watch Drake drop his a week after just to kill there buzz. That would smart marketing
J Cole an Kendrick. L drop their heat on February 16 the same day of my birthday HINTHINT COUGHCOUGH that'll be a good b day present.

@_flexout12 well then you need to take Kendrick Lamar off cause his last album wasn't good you probably just going off of Black Friday ....
@ColemanESPN I find that Kendrick Lamar is good to listen to when you're out on a Friday night driving for Uber. 'Sing About Me' is a cut!
"Happy to see Kendrick Lamar nominated for a Grammy.  He may not win, but good to see the best of us getting recognized"
Kendrick Lamar has surprised us with an extraordinary freestyle on black friday. he got this inspiration from the legendary J.COLE
"Kendrick Lamar's Black Friday verse was Lit.  Too lyrical and poetic,  I have it on repeat infact Threepeat.  JCole was good too though"
back to Black Friday.... do u guys even hear what Kendrick Lamar is saying?!? how he says it? good gawd.

@robotovee yeah i still remember their HQ at Hongdae. So small. So happy that they r the 3rd largest company in Kpop now
@tifftiffannie haha 8th - 11th grade was strong with the Kpop. We're always in sync lol
Am I the only one thinking that Kpop used to be so fun back then? I mean the 2nd Generation was the best.

I love Kris Bryant. The way he plays 3rd is Santo-esque. But  damn that was a nice play by Herrerra
"I'm so excited for the Cubs game tomorrow! I can't wait! Jon Lester on the hill, Kris Bryant just feet away, and a pennant chase! #WeAreGood"
I'm surprised that was only Harper's 3rd walk of the year after falling behind 0-2. Kris Bryant leads baseball with 10.
If Kris Bryant becomes Chris Davis are #Cubs fans mad? I would take that. Davis this season 6th in homers leads the AL in RBI.
"If it ain't broke don't fix it, why move kris Bryant up to 3rd when he's hitting as good as he has all season at 5"
Kris Bryant belted a two-run walk-off homer with two outs in the ninth Monday night to power the Cubs to a 9-8... http://t.co/WLHUHx3ZRh
Kris Bryant injured sliding into 2nd after RBI. Hope he is ok #Cubs
Kris Bryant is 16th in MLB in WAR as a rookie. Love when people say he's having a bad year
Kris Bryant is pretty good at baseball. I think he just might have a future in it. #youhearditherefirst https://t.co/sSmIvCix4S
"Kris Bryant sent Cubs fans home happy Monday, belting a walk-off, solo home run in the ninth inning versus the Indians."
Kris Bryant singles. That must feel good. B2B singles. Men on 1st and 2nd with one out.
Kris Bryant will make October 7th come faster don't worry everyone.
"Lester goes 8 and 2/3 strong, gives up a run in 9th. Kris Bryant hits a walk off to win, Lester doesn't get the W. Heartbreaking for owners!"
"Still hyped rn! Kris Bryant is my favorite player, he got his 1st walk off homer, the Cubs got an important W and are staying in the hunt"
Thank you Joey Votto... Thank you my good friend.. and thanks for that 4th out Kris Bryant... how you doin Cubbies?? HaHa  #serieswin #Reds

@SkySportsTennis Murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing Djokovic
@SkySportsTennis it's a joke! Troicki v young into a 5th set and on Sky go we are forced to watch Murray walking into the practice court???
Beginning to worry Murray may be stuck on two grand slams for the rest of his career.
"Booo, Murray gets broke early in the 2nd set. It's not as if he's playing bad, Anderson is playing exceptional tennis here. #USOpen"
I LOVE how aggressive both Serena &amp; Venus are being off the 2nd serve return. Murray would lose this match! @cbfowler @bgtennisnation
If Murray loses this 2nd set I'm pretty sure he won't win this.
"Murray in real trouble now, down a break in the 3rd #USOpen Looking angry and frustrated"
Murray misses a good chance to break at the start of the 4th. Sloppy along with a brilliant shot from Anderson denies the break. #USOpen
@Betweenthehedge @VivianJo1 @cosmosmom1952 Don't you just love them to pieces?!?! Murray is my 3rd. I can only handle one at a time tho. lol
"@KCChiefs_58 well, I think KC may have a good QB for the future in Murray."
@LewisKing__ @LouisWhyman @DCBlueStar I'm saying Murray was good but it great. Randle and dmc are just as good if it better. CM is 4th RB
@MurrayBarnett thanks for hosting us Murray. Had a great time. Good luck for the cup. May the best team win. They usually do.
"@SeanTierneyTSS If Murray comes back well, he'll be the 2nd/3rd best D maybe Johnson. I'd want him for the Leafs for sure."
@SkySportsTennis it's why I love tennis. One minute looks like murray is down and out. Next minute anything is possible! C'mon @andy_murray
A good  hold from Murray. 5-3 in 2nd. How is Anderson's head coping with this now?
Bellucci played a great 3rd set but Murray was just too good. He advances into week 2 with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 7-5 win #TeamMurray #usopen
Come on Murray dig deep...I'm going to be tired for work tomorrow if I have to stay up for a 5-setter @SkySportsTennis
Good straight sets win for Murray last night hope he kicks on from here and good chance of winning the #USOpen for a 2nd time
"Happy 6th birthday to Murray who celebrates with us @Falkirkbairns today! We hope you, your friends and family enjoy your special day!"
"Just as I say how good Anderson has been, Murray goes 3-1 up in the 3rd. Of course. #USOpen"
Morning from #Woking where it is a dull start but hoping for sun to break through later. Couldn't stay up for end of Murray's match. :(
Mr. Murray gave me some really great life advice in the 7th grade and I was too much of a little douchebag to appreciate it.
Murray gets the break he needed. Even's things in the 3rd. Anderson has 3 sets to fail if Murray hopes to win.
Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray
Murray now holds to love and he levels the 4th set at 5-5. Pressure straight back on Anderson. His longest match at the Open #USOpen
Murray struggling at moment but I think he'll come strong in 3rd &amp; 4th set to take it to decider #USOpen2015
"Piers Newbery : @piersnewbery:  Murray breaks back in the 3rd, huge roar, crowd loving it. Not sure Lamps expe...... http://t.co/HRAiTsXvzq"
"Really great match this now. Anderson is going for broke on every Murray 2nd serve, and Murray is winning most rally points now. #USOpen2015"
Superb from Anderson. Good fight from Murray as always. 2nd serve just ain't strong enough imo.
This Murray vs Anderson match is great. 4 hour match and it's still in the 4th set.
"We're going to a 4th set!! Murray just dominated that tiebreak, wins it 7-2. He's pumped up now!! #USOpen2015 #Murray"

"Luckily the boys don't have a show tomorrow, really hope Niall will feel better soon :("
"Niall is probably going to see 5sos tomorrow in NJ, love my luck :))"
"Niall is so beautiful his blue eyes, his smile he shines like a star or a sun he makes my day he's just so unconventionally beautiful."
Niall is so freaking cute j can't just imagine him sat there on his phone/laptop scrolling through all our tweets and laughing to himself
Niall on april 24th 2015 the best day he looked so good
Niall posted a pic of his hairy leg in the sun and im like wtf the fuck why so I scrolled and there was Zayn's beautiful face thank u
"On Niall's birthday on Sunday the 13th, we should all tweet a video on why we love and appreciate him. #HappyBirthdayNiall"
Today is 27 August meaning @opianjh has otra today and I hope she has the bestest time ever and that Niall wears this http://t.co/pPeUwq48Rq
Why is everyone talking about Niall's bday it's not until the 13th ok I have 8 more days until I panic bc he's 22
do you know that moment when you stare at the sun and your eyes start to cry because it's so bright? that happens to me when i look at Niall
"do you remember when Niall sang ""Beautiful Girls"" in his 21st birthday, good times can he just sing that again like can he just do it please"

"wanted to say that you're my beautiful little idiot, you may be as funny as Harry but it's cute. P.S: Niall loves his princess;) @cumlarry_"
"we don't get enough Niall in yellow, I don't like the color but he looks like the sun in it #MTVHottest One Direction"
@MileyCyrus I dreamed about katy perry dragging Nicki's back for you on sunday and it was very fatal. I hope it's gonna happen
@TMZ Miley may act and be the way she is but she is a good person. Nicki is the one looking for fights anywhere. Embarrassing...
"All Nicki said was ""what's good"" like c'mon now we get it she a bad bitch ok"
"And tomorrow Nicki is going to be seen as ""a raging angry black women"" for calling Miley out of something that she is GUILTY for"
Do you guys remember that not too long ago Nicki was like one of the most hated artist.. During her Pink Friday album
I'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and Nicki is being the shady bitch queen she is and I just lost all focus
"Miley is the 8th most hated person in America, idk why y'all are acting like Nicki gets more hate than Miley"
"So whats good Miley? @MileyCyrus ...lol Nicki with that fuck shit,we may as well make a song about it. Hit me up. I ghost write like Quentin"
@Likeitornotmama @jda927 Lil Kim will be remembered as the 3rd/4th most successful female rapper. Nicki will/is the 1st. Numbers don't lie.
@NICKIMINAJ hey Nicki i was going to wish you happy independence on monday from Trinidad
@NickiHunter happy humpday Nicki enjoy your Wednesday. Super love and miss you. Xoxo sweetpea
@TeaMasterT People need to full-stop stop using that for White characters. Full-stop. It's EXACTLY what Nicki criticized in the 1st place.
"@ZeusBarker true, but she was flapping her gums, I'm glad Nicki sat her down. Someone needed to show her what she said was foul."
"@mari_fminaj @THEQUEEN0FRAPI do not know, Pink Friday has the best song Nicki: Super Bass but the pinkprint has invincible like Anaconda"
Everyone in my feminist studies class was team Nicki AND the Mitski tinydesk was released today WHAT A MONDAY !!!!
"I feel like so much happened on the VMAs.  Kanye, Taylor, Nicki and Miley, Miley released new music.. The news is gonna be CRAY tomorrow."
I have a feeling that Nicki's performance at the VMAs  will be the only good one tomorrow
I hope Nicki attends the Givenchy show Friday.
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/oyey81EYQ5 Nicki Minaj - Dear Old Nicki with lyrics - Pink Friday
I love Nicki and Miley and may need to call in sick tomorrow because of it
I may not love all of nicki's music but she is queen
I start school tomorrow and I'm only going because I don't want Nicki to be mad at me
I used to bump Nicki aalllll the time in middle school. Pink Friday was my fav
I want Nicki to fight Miley on a national awards show so bad and tonight may be the night
I'm Team Nicki but I would never openly say something bad about Taylor Swift because I think she may have snipers on retainer.
Nicki fighting all the rich flat ass divas 1st Taylor swift now miley cyrus
Nicki getting hood just then gave me so much motivation to go to school tomorrow and get good grades and go to college I'm so alive
Nicki is a great woman I don't care what you say. I may don't like her music a lot but she's very intelligent.
"Nicki is truly a loving and forgiving God, may we all show the same mercy she has shown to taylor to those who have wronged us. Amen."
Nicki may not be a vocalist but she sure doesn't sound a mess when she sings  https://t.co/MumZ7ZKK8c
Pretty sure Nicki's ass is the 8th wonder of the world
"Professor: ""read 8 chapters by Friday"" Me: @ Nicki I hope you know I'm doing this for you"
Remember the times we used to fast forward songs to Nicki's parts? Now she'll slay with a 3rd album out. Onika gurl. I love it.
What a great weekend. First Drake was in the 'Ville Saturday then Nicki went for Miley's life tonight. What a time to be alive
"What makes me sad is how tomorrow morning, the media is gonna portray Nicki as the stereotypical ""angry black woman"" &amp; make Miley the victim"
Why do y'all want Nicki to be pregnant so bad like maybe around the 7th album but she's literally still in her prime.
"Y'all was gna be mad at Nicki anyway. She just stole all the headlines for tomorrow, keep fuming bitches! New Queen of the VMA's."
"hi Nicki u famous n I know, but ama keep it short. I love u dearly, though u n d world may think am crazy cos De say I write blindly."
i can literally feel my vision improving because of nicki and kanye!! tomorrow i will be such a good day!!
i'm glad Nicki called Miley out but tomorrow the media gone have Nicki looking like another angry black woman. smh.
"yeah i love Nicki and yeah Miley may have said something but Miley has a point, journalists always manipulate what is said, Nicki just"

"@garysnowpatrol if you have time tomorrow, the @EMPmuseum has some great exhibits. Nirvana, Hendrix, Star Wars costumes..."
"Back in 9th grade, I told people how my favorite song was Nirvana by Sam. People said ""never heard of the song and the guy must not be good"""
"Been watching 'montage of heck' and liking it a lot, love to map his march to being an artist and nirvana becoming great.."
Can't wait to go to @kidsfest with nirvana on Sunday. And for a great cause @jbmt1 .. Everyone should get down and show support
Had a dream that I saw Nirvana live and Kurt Cobain sat and split his cigarette with me afterward and told me about life. Woke up sad.
Happy almost weekend! Celebrate your Thursday with a nice cold chocolate nirvana at $1 off!
I feel so enlightened. what do I do with my life now. I may have reached nirvana.
I hate Jon for making me watch the Kurt Cobain documentary because I'll end up listening to Nirvana all day tomorrow.
"I have School by Nirvana stuck in my head, along with January 28th &amp; Apparently by J. Cole. Not necessarily a bad thing lol"
"I hope I see that cute boi with the nirvana shirt, tomorrow"
I hope tomorrow is a better effing day! Drift nirvana better be lit
I just can't believe I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with a dude that doesn't get how good Nirvana is....... Like dude c'mon
I love real friends and ptv and taking back Sunday and fiatc and neck deep and knuckle puck and ymas and tonight alive and nirvana and

When you gotta read a chapter of a book and then write a 4 page paper on it but you're just jamming to Nirvana. Tomorrow's gonna be sick.
You know you're having a good time when you play Nirvana full blast in the office after hours and dance like there's no tomorrow. #mflpogo

"when people insult Nirvana it's sooooo hard to maintain my anger, yeah they may not be your thing but there's no need to critise their music"
Everyone's excited for Paper Towns releasing tomorrow but take it from me the movie was absolutely horrible

I saw Paper Towns on Friday with some friends and it was AMAZING! It might have been different from the book but I absolutely loved it!! :D
I saw Paper Towns on Wednesday and I really loved it but I was a little disappointed in how Margo was portrayed in the movie....
I went to see Paper Towns as a way to get away from the sun and see a mindless young adult film with a happy ending. (1/2)
I'm so happy; I'm going to see PAPER TOWNS tomorrow!
"I'm still laughing that when Paper Towns ended me, Liv, and Anna were all just sat having an existential crisis fuck sake"
I've always been slow at reading books. Currently trying to power through the rest of Paper Towns as I'm seeing the film tomorrow

Not a great start for the amateur Paul Dunne. Imagine having to compose yourself to hit your third ball (5th shot) off the tee on hole 2!
1500:1 Vegas odds on Paul Dunne actually making it to the final rnd.. No matter what happens be proud!! Go get it Mon bud!! #AmateurChampion
@MolloyJoe This Paul Dunne story is Unbelievable but I hope this Legend does it Tomorrow! #helookslikemaryrobinson http://t.co/O0t8yvXJSV
@rq1927 @seymouranthony @harryhill99 @therealkp1985 The Open - Leaderboard http://t.co/9uqxaYOdLf love it hope Paul Dunne is top tomorrow?
Absolutely fantastic stuff from Paul Dunne today. Keep the dream alive tomorrow
"Also in tomorrow's @metrosportHQ, all the details of a fabulous day for Paul Dunne and an enthralling third round at St Andrews. #TheOpen"
"Amazing round from Paul Dunne, fantastic to see amateurs not only making the cut but actually contending.Hope he does well tomorrow #theopen"
"As bad as I'd like to see Jordan Spieth win The Open, this Paul Dunne kid is something else. Can't wait to see it unfold tomorrow!"
Best of luck to Paul Dunne this afternoon. He has already been brilliant and made us proud. May he play a great... http://t.co/eC7bMTJOQs
Delighted for that young man Paul Dunne making the British Isles so proud today.  A bad round tomorrow &amp; you'll be Irish again #TheOpen2015
Fair play to Paul Dunne....mighty three rounds of golf.. lets hope he is in the last group tomorrow!!
Fancy this Paul Dunne at the open at 40/1 would make it a good Monday
"Forgetting about the money, I'd just be so happy to see Paul Dunne do it tomorrow. Stuff of fairy tales! Wicklow lad too.. #represent"
Great day of sun and blue skies!Great day of Sport! Paul Dunne story of the day! Aussies weren't half bad either!
"Hats off to Paul Dunne there, played some great Golf today, deserves to be in the final grouping tomorrow. #TheOpen2015"
How can you not root for Paul Dunne tomorrow? With all the mini tours I didn't think there were amateurs capable of contending at a major.
If Paul Dunne wins tomorrow I'm going to feel stupid for not betting a dollar on him #1500-1ods
"It was just a good day, I felt comfortable and hope for the same tomorrow -- Paul Dunne: http://t.co/iANzi9KD3z http://t.co/lsBlooyXU8"
"Last week Paul Dunne was fighting for a Walker Cup spot, now he's fighting for the Open. Unbelievable - really hope he does well tomorrow."
Massive reception for Paul Dunne on the packed 18th. Such a mature and composed head on such young shoulders. Great round of 66. #bbcgolf
"Paul Dunne (A) did an amazing job in today's Open. Well done @dunners11 and good luck for tomorrow. We know you are Irish - now, @bbcsports"
"Paul Dunne had some day today at St.Andrews... Brilliant achievement so far for an amateur, be great to see him stay in touch tomorrow."
"Paul Dunne is going to be so nervous tomorrow, awesome he's in that position though. Hope he has a chance to win late tomorrow!"
Paul Dunne is tied for 1st at the open and he's a proud #UABBlazer   shutout to my ace @naive_n_sassy  #BlazerLife
"Paul Dunne living the dream! Shame he's gonna have to pull a sickie from work tomorrow, hope his boss turns a blind eye! #TheOpen2015"
Paul Dunne may only get a silver medal if he wins #TheOpen today but one suspects he won't need to worry about money for a while if he does.

"if anyone would like to surprise me with some Sam Smith tickets for Monday, that'd be great. Plz and thank you."
just checked for events happening at Gila River Arena in September and I got SO excited to see that Sam Smith is playing. On September 30th
"my mom still isnt sure if she can go to sam smith with me or not tomorrow, she needs to let me know so i can find someone else to go with"
"oh, hi! just listening to sam smith's ""like i can"" and weeping! happy wednesday!"
"yesterday ericka n I went to the hotel where sam smith was staying n sat in the lobby for a good 2 hrs n saw 2 guys that seemed ""important"""

@OfficialPWI BY HAVING Seth Rollins as number 1? All credibility is lost. May be the worst WWE champion in history! WWE owns yall?
Don't want to hear Seth Rollins Speech about how great he is tomorrow bruh.
I'm so mad Seth Rollins is going to talk so much tomorrow on raw kiwi fuck I'm so mad
John cent vs Seth Rollins: am I the only one who's not gonna be happy Sunday in the John cena vs Seth Rollins ... http://t.co/SaUb0sIiNw
Jon Stewart cheating he helps Seth Rollins win that some cheap Monday Night Raw comes on tomorrow and I'm not going to be happy
May not watch #RAW tonight I was already tired of Seth Rollins when he retained against Brock. Just think how big he's head going to be now.
"Seth Rollins may be a good superstar to date, but he is no legend! He needs to put that statue behind him and focus on Sting. #RAW"
Seth Rollins won't be happy till he loses the wwe championship to @JohnCena on Sunday #TheRoadToSummerSlam #raw
@JohnCena ohn cena you are my favorite wrestler of all time great match with Seth Rollins on Monday night raw sorry you broke your nose.
@WWE @Sting @WWERollins  I'm going for Seth Rollins to win. Sting may put up a good match but won't be enough.
"@WWE, I'm sure you've heard that Jay Lethal wants to cross brands and wrestle Seth Rollins. That belongs on Monday's RAW and would be huge."
@WWERollins @CFBelltown Seth Rollins great match with Neville on Monday night raw very entertaining match
A feud with John Cena may be enough to make me interested in Seth Rollins again. There has to be some irony in there.
As long as Seth Rollins leaves with his title Sunday night then I'll be happy #RAW #TitleForTitle
As much as I love John Cena and respect him as a champion I want Seth Rollins to win tomorrow night!
I fucking love Seth Rollins and would be so happy if he walked away with two belts next Sunday.
I hope that John Cena wins the wwe world heavyweight champion for the 16th time &amp; Seth Rollins is right the future is now. #titlefortitle
"I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/ovUOjsIjG0 WWE RAW, Seth Rollins vs Randy Orton for the WWE World Heavyweight Champion, Aug 10,"
"I really hope the @WWE are working on a ""Hall of Fame"" style bust for Seth Rollins for Monday. @WWERollins #SethRollinsistheCure"
"It's $125 for the Seth Rollins meet and greet on Friday. Seth, I love you and all and your my favorite wrestler but HELL NO"
Just got done watching wwe Monday night raw I'm glad Seth rollins stayed the champion Randy Orton came close of being the champion
My son's braden 8th birthday got money in the bank briefcase due to Seth Rollins. Can you say happy birthday seth rollins to my son?
"Saturday Night Observation: I'm really surprised Seth Rollins never ""had to"" change his hair style after winning the World Title."
"Seth Rollins has nothing to worry about. As long as he wears white and gold, he'll be fine on the 20th. #WWE #Raw #ColorsOfChampions"
"Seth Rollins may have lost, but he broke Cena!  #RAWSanJose"
Seth rollins would have been a great champion if he does all things whatever he says every monday night on #raw in the middle of this ring
That was stupid by John Stewart but who cares Seth Rollins is now the 1st man to hold WWE title &amp; US title together #SummerSlam
Tonight Monday night was fucking great a lot of supper stars came and so did sting and he beat the hell out of Seth Rollins that's we do
"Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch......... This Sunday, Imma make you mines. - @JohnCena to Seth Rollins, lmao that was a great promo."
WWE Fans glad thank you @StephMcMahon @WWEUniverse  Sting vs. Seth Rollins John Cena vs. Seth Rollins  Good Luck Sunday Sept 20!
What a amazing Monday Night Raw!! Epic ending so excited to see @Sting challenge Seth Rollins for the WWE Championship #RAW #WWE #Sting
When was the last time we've had a subpar Monday Night #Raw? Tonight looks to be no different! Seth Rollins is gold.
YAAASSS hire him full time so he and Seth Rollins can beef forever https://t.co/30K6SHOohk
"Yeah, I think I want a Seth Rollins shirt. Cuz that's what champions do. His 1st-X-Men-movie-costume pants wouldn't hurt, either. #raw"
"@MattFossen @FrankConniff 1st, they did do Plan 9. 2nd, Sharknado is not earnestly bad, it's ironically so. That's why MST3K wouldn't work"
@yuu_naoyuki this is the 3rd one. Check Sharknado and Sharknado 2 too. XD it's horrible that it's hilarious. This is a really bad movie.
"A 60 mile flame burning hotter than the surface of the sun!?!  Come on Sharknado, that is even ridiculous for you."
All you people watching Sharknado tomorrow are they terrorists hate us.
I am not in the right frame of mind to attempt to watch Sharknado 3 yet. I may need to start drinking.
I can't believe people really like Sharknado enough for them to make a 3rd part. So stupid.
"I don't even understand how Sharknado is even a thing, let alone having a 3rd movie. The SE suck, the acting sucks, and it's so dumb I laugh"
I dont understand the obsession with Sharknado.... watched the first two and they sucked. Im sure the 3rd one is just as bad.
I hate the Sharknado fandom. It's a poor imitation of so bad it's good. Also I  don't care if April lives #suckmynado
I sat through the whole of Sharknado 2 I'm pretty sure NS is nothing compared to that shit.
"I think Sharknado 3 may have jumped the shark, and gone too far down the make a bad movie road. The second half is just awful in a bad way."
It may be significant to some of those who enjoy movies with a cult following but Sharknado is a disgrace to the film industry
Okay the first Sharknado was funny but do we really need a 4th movie? I think I lost a few brain cells after watching the 3rd
"Sharknado 3 comes on tonight. Yes, a movie about a shark tornado has made it to a 3rd movie, and yes, I too have lost all faith in humanity."
"Sharknado is the silliest film franchise so badly produced I cudnt stop laughing through the 2nd, I saw sharks flying n had to call it a day"
Sharknado may well be the flat out dumbest thing ever to occupy a TV screen.
Sharknado was funny the first time. We humored them for the 2nd. But a THIRD? Even I'm not enough of a fan of bad movies to watch that shit.
"The 1st Sharknado was good, the 2nd bad and the 3rd was just pathetic. They are making a 4th, but I'm done with them now! #sharknado"
Who knew there were enough people in the world easily pleased by shite like Sharknado that they're getting a 4th instalment?!
"@Adam_Squid_Ward yo dawg, friendly reminder about Sharknado tomorrow. You still up to come?"
"@IanZiering Thank you, Ian, for making ""Sharknado"" our family's new guilty pleasure!!!  Can't wait for the 4th! #AprilLives"
@MadhuCheri tomorrow night is red carp[et premiere of Sharknado 3. Cindy has a great cameo in it.
@TaraReid  Never had a need for Twitter. Then Sharknado made the public responsible for April's life. Hope to see you in Sharknado 4.
@TaraReid I hope to see u in Sharknado 4! April just gave birth to a baby inside a freaking shark! she can survive everything! #AprilLives
@TaraReid can't wait to see what happens to April in sharknado 4 hope she lives
@YesItsColin  Always a good time with Sharknado and Twitter. Plays again Saturday at 7
"@keselowski On Hell No...great job in Sharknado. See you in Daytona in February your Body Guard from SR Perrott. Have a""Lite"" Day Brad."
@prettybaby69 Are you going to watch Lavalantula tomorrow night on SyFy? Looks pretty good. Has some big shoes to fill because of Sharknado.
A happy fun loving Saturday 2 the wonderful @TaraReid true CHAMPION of Sharknado films an always shows the love 2 everyone across the world
"Finally getting a chance to watch Sharknado 3. I liked the 1st one a lot and loved the 2nd one, so I've really been looking forward to it."
Going to get drunk and watch the badness that is Sharknado 3. This is going to be a good Sunday night.
Hanging with my Monsters on a Saturday night watching Sharknado ! They love it ! #Sharknado3 http://t.co/ckzCiTZVlZ
Happy Sharknado 3 eve. May the plot be thin and the cameos ridiculous.
"I have grown to love @TaraReid's character, April, throughout the Sharknado franchise. #Sharknado3"
I hope I can catch Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No tomorrow night idc how bad it is
I just found out Sharknado 3 comes out tomorrow night. I'm beyond excited
I may get killed for this but I watched 15 minutes of pretty little liars. The girls acting ability is as good as the acting in Sharknado.
"I see Jimmy made it into sharknado, so wnci should be hilarious tomorrow."
Is it weird I'm excited for Sharknado 3 tomorrow night?
Make sure to watch Sharknado 3 Hell No tomorrow! @maryse0uellet is in the movie! but you'll have to find her ;)
"My kids look forward to the Sharknado movies, because they are awesomely horrible....and we need April! #AprilLives"
My mom is really lecturing me about how Sharknado is such a good movie &amp; that everyone watches it which is why they came out with a 3rd one.
"Oh you know, just making sure my schedule tomorrow allows me to watch SHARKNADO 3"
"Ok. Tonight ""Sharknado 3"", the 25th ""Lavantula"", oh you are so lucky US friends!"
Sharknado 3 tomorrow if your not excited you ain't living right
So I notice on SyFy website you can vote if April lives or dies in Sharknado 4. Essentially they announced Shaknado 4... What a great day!
Stop what you're doing. Sharknado is on syfy channel. And Sharknado 3 premieres tomorrow night. Life is good
This may be pathetic but I'm soo excited for Sharknado 3. Best to watch with lil kids tho.
Watched Sharknado tonight with mom while she recovered from surgery. Now she wants to watch 2 and 3 tomorrow. I love my mom.
You'd think with as successful a franchise as Sharknado they could splurge a little on the crappy cgi for this 3rd installment.
i am so excited to watch sharknado after work tomorrow no one even gets it
such a good ending to SHARKNADO 3!  YOU DECIDE BY TWITTER HASHTAG IF APRIL LIVES OR DIES!  the answer will be... http://t.co/9xIQwd7afq

"I'm so glad Shawn is going to London, Spain and more countries in Europe since he has much more fans than he had back in February/March"
I'm so nervous for next Tuesday I'm so excited to see who's going to brought on the stage with shawn
I'm so upset that Shawn is going to be 5 hours from me tomorrow and I can't go because it's a school night
I've never ever won a radio contest before &amp; Shawn never does them when he's in California so seeing him tomorrow makes me so happy
Idk it's whatever. But if somebody went to a Shawn concert and got 4th row while I was stuck in the back and didn't know his name id be mad
Im so nervous bc my cousin and I going to buy the ticket to see Shawn in September 12th
Im so upset i dont get to see shawn on tuesday like hes my everyythingg(besides nash cam and twins) and im just really sad:(
My heart hurts I really need to shawn when he goes on my bday to Texas in October I hope I find tickets some how:(
"OHMYGOD WHEN MACKELMORE SAT DOWN SHAWN WENT UP TO HIM ALL NERVOUS AND SAID ""hi nice to meet you im shawn mendes"" THATS SO CUTE"
"Ok it's September 5th, the concert is over, Shawn liked 2 vines I was in, Ally pointed at me, I'm not at playlist live IM OVERWHELMED"
People need to stop getting so butthurt over the fact joi is getting to see Shawn in October she deserves it so much I'm gonna be happy
SHAWN.. Go to sleep please? Saving your beautiful angelic voice for us tomorrow. Love you!
"Shawn is like Sun in the morning, it's bright, hot and always makes you smile."
"Shawn makes me so happy nobody understands, you may think you do, but you don't."
Shawn may be young but acts so mature and thats one of the things you should love about him
"Shawn's a smart guy, he may be young but he knows what he's talking about."
So glad Shawn has a show Wednesday night if he came to jack and jacks show I would not be on stage
Thanks very much Shawn! I hope you're having a great Monday! https://t.co/FYhZT554UJ
"Tomorrow is going to be my tenth time seeing Shawn perform, I'm so lucky to be able to even once, this is so insane"
"We imperfect humans receive second or, sometimes, multiple chances. Keep up the good work, Shawn! #SicEmBears https://t.co/JnqPfMd3RO"

"Don't forget to catch Thor, I mean Chris Hemsworth on Saturday Night Live tonight! https://t.co/WRoLErD1Jm"
Happy Monday everyone.  I hope the week is off to a good start across the board. Here's a Thor sketch by Mike. #art https://t.co/LrD92nHgn6
I am thankful for @bitchy_antics for pointing out how all the animals in the shop sat up when Thor strided in there!!!! ROFL #Thor
I got really excited for the cosplay cover of Thor tomorrow and then I remembered that Kevin is on issue 2 :/
I like how Thor is bragging about making Esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings.
I love that Thor's cover was inspired by Madvillainy's cover that was inspired by the cover for Madonna's 1st LP. https://t.co/cwsS6zz09Q
"I'm loving all these quotes from the cry baby Royals about Thor's 1st pitch to Escobar. If I'm Matz, I'm doing the same thing Saturday."
"It has to be Thor for me @marvel love the character, and Chris Hemsworth plays him well. I feel Civalwar may change this tho! #Marvel2015"
May you all have a great Thor's day! #Asatru #awakenthenorth #vikingclan
"My phone corrected you to Thu so instead of ""I believe in you"" I said ""I believe in Thursday.""  Thor would be happy with this news."
"Ok imma sleep, goodnight Have a good Thursday, if you can, I hate Thursdays But Thursday used to be Thor's day so that's cool Almost Friday"
"Pretty sure of the 1st like 25 Marvel characters, 2 had capes. Dr. Strange and Thor. And by the way a cape totally works on Dr. Strange."
Regardless of what happens- Thor's recovery from the 1st and his middle innings here give me hope for the future #LGM #Mets
Sif's crush on Thor is adorable but also sad she should just hook up with may
So apparently Thor has a big surprise for me on Saturday and I can't wait to see what it is!!!! I'm dying I'm the most patient less person
So excited for new Thor on wednesday. I just finished @jasonaaron's last run and it's been so wonderful.
So....... I may be obsessed with Thor now .... and sorta Loki.... especially of the slash pair known as Thorki @chrishemsworth @twhiddleston
"Thanks for an amazing season, Thor!  Have a happy (&amp; HEALTHY) winter, and we'll see you in February!  #LGM  https://t.co/pxY9ijRqqa"
Thor and April love the laundry basket. #catsofinstagram https://t.co/tU4ZJpZaG2
Thor is a throw back kind of pitcher. I love it!!!!  https://t.co/EAm51LNbHR
Thor is still a great movie after the 3rd time.
Thor thinks he's a lap dog and a face cleaner... Fun personality for sure :) He will be with us again tomorrow in... https://t.co/ZAyhg0n341
"What's nice about CY pitching tomorrow night, he won't lose focus like Ventura did after Thor singled. We can't go to a game 7 with YV"
"a full season of Harvey, deGrom, Thor, Matz and Wheeler coming back in June?? sign me up. Lets get Heyward, some bullpen call it a day"
I hate @CJ_Mathews23 right now. How dare you pick Tom Brady in the 4th round.
I hope Tom Brady gets fucking clobbered about 699 times next Sunday
I hope the Steelers CRUSH Tom Brady on Thursday. Damn cheater.
I just drafted Tom Brady in the 6th round and I'm disgusted with myself
Tom Brady may have became the most hated person in the NFL over the last few months
Tom Brady probably cheated his way to winning the 8th grade science fair smh
"Tom Brady seriously said ""...to a large degree, we have all lost."" C'mon man!  Can you not even briefly pretend not to be a huge douche?"
#NFL kicks off this Thursday!  Tom Brady is going to destroy Pitt! I feel bad for anyone getting in Bradys way right now as he is pissed
@EKShow TOM BRADY WILL START THURSDAY...HAHA HATERS!!!!! @fantasyEK that work file? You mean his personal cell phone? Are you mad bro?
@JuiceKovacs I don't get the Davis love. I mean sure as a 3rd string guy he's ok but he's no starter or Tom Brady
@cesarin06 the sun is already shining for me. Tom Brady can play football and that evil Kim Davis is rotting in jail #gooddays
@mjarvi83 I think good QB's are good QB's. What's the argument for why Tom Brady was a 6th round pick? Belichick made him great? I'm asking.
"Aside from all this ESPN bullshit, Who do you guys think will have a good game on Thursday, ASIDE from Tom Brady"
Ben Roethlisberger says he isn't surprised Tom Brady won case http://t.co/9mVGxnxEmu #steelersvspatriots THURSDAY
Can't wait until Thursday night for football and watch the best QB Tom Brady come out onto the field a starter and finally be free. #goPats
"Good morning and happy Tuesday with Tom Brady's ""The Balls Song"" http://t.co/pdWBLNlPJU"
Gotta love the Tom Brady  network lol C'Mon man stop riding this guy @MikeAndMike #cheater
"I kind of had a good guy to look up to, he was a 6th rd draft pick &amp; he's the greatest quarterback of all-time, #Texans Hoyer on Tom Brady"
I love me some College Football but I can't wait to watch some Tom Brady and the Patriots play on Thursday. #NFL
I really care to think about what I need to do going forward...I'm excited to be able to go out there and do it. Tom Brady on Sunday.
"It's good to kno the NFL season starts Thursday, so we can hear about other teams other then Tom Brady an the Pats! #iDontCareIfTheyCheated"
"SAT STAT: Tom Brady is set to make his 14th straight opening day start, the longest active streak in the league. http://t.co/eTBi4oIU7D"
So happy I passed on Jonas Gray and picked up Tom Brady in the 13th round. #blessed
So what I'm focusing on is motivating Tom Brady and my team  I want them to have a great game Thursday
"The Donald on whose on 1st; the Kurds, no the Quds, no, Tom Brady ""yes"", ""...I can talk abt him all day, great guy, fabulous"" #thtsDonald"
There's taking the high road and then there's what Tom Brady said about Roger Goodell Sunday. How smart was Brady... http://t.co/TgRH0demrS
"Thursday will mark Tom Brady's 14th consecutive opening day start, the largest active streak in the NFL! http://t.co/DcyQ7M9NKL"
"Tom Brady will play Thursday night with all his weapons Gronk, Amendola, etc. Should be good. Goodell must be pissed!"
Very surprised Tom Brady was willing to speak at his locker room about the #DeflateGate decision. Can't wait until Thursday.
Wish today was Thursday! Tom Brady and @Patriots take the field for the real deal tomorrow and I'm toooo excited! #BeerWingsFootball

Arch-Zoggie Tony Blair's fudged apology that he may have been responsible for the rise of IS is a carefully calculated manouver on his part

"Tony Blair: sympathies for ISIS ""stretch deep into parts of Muslim societies"". Blair just went full Trump. https://t.co/NNVPamARUC"
Why does tony blair get the right to be invited to remembrance sunday?
if the retaliation to Friday is more destruction can we at least have tony blair tried for the war crimes he committed
Love a good bit of 'Tony Blair shame on you' on a Saturday. #DontBombSyria
Tony Blair is right: Without the Iraq war there would be no Islamic State! #UniteBlue https://t.co/tTgNcdiZPx
"10th anniv of Twilight books Meyer released version w/main characters gender swapped. But true to original stories, the writing still sucks."
@TerryGilliam Sat my daughter down and we watched 12 Monkeys. Changed her mind about what a really good movie is (NOT Twilight)
@twats0n what are you some stupid Twilight vampire? REAL ones don't go outside to tan. They sleep in complete darkness until the sun is down
"Did the sun even be bother to get up today? Desperate for a holiday tho, even if it is in a frozen twilight ._."
"Flatmate night in watching Twilight for the 1st time, not sure if Im more shocked that its so misogynistic or that its just such a bad movie"
"Sat in the dark listening to twilight sad. Really, really upsetting"
"Watching 50 Shades of Grey for the 1st time... it's SO bad. Like ""Twilight,"" if Edward were a shitty Dom and Bella was... well, still vapid."
the 1st twilight is soooo bad
twilight may be a really shitty movie franchise but the soundtracks are so good
@13millionplus @chrislhayes Going to see The Big Short tomorrow(so excited) &amp; have started re-reading Twilight of the Elites.
@AintNoWaifu I was obsessed with Twilight in 7th grade I loved it so much
"@BrisRacingClub we went to twilight races last Friday and it was great, EF markets food stall people would be a gr8 addition.#nextime"
"@HeatherSchultz Did you ever read the little bit of Midnight Sun that got leaked online. Twilight from Edward's perspective, SO good!"
"@Swagforth oh god, i love the water temple in twilight princess so much, it's my 2nd favourite in the game. who's your least fave boss?"
@booksbrainsbeer I use an app called Twilight to automatically dim my screens and tint them red after the sun sets; it helps a lot.
"@paigeteague_ Edward, idk if it'll turn into a movie though, it was for the 10th twilight anniversary,it's so so good xx"
"@yulisasome In 5th grade I fell down some stairs, fractured my left leg, got a concussion. The next day I bought the full Twilight series"
Are you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Twilight may be a solution for you!  R https://t.co/MRFlABJuDf
"Chapter two of Twilight done, yay :D If I'm really lucky I may get a third done before we hit the road on Wednesday. Fingers crossed!"
Glad I watched Twilight.  Now I'm not alarmed when I see @Fresh_Lezinto out in the sun
"Gonna stream Umineko again on Tuesday or Wednesday. Will probably hit the second twilight at least, I hope."
"Got bored, so I read Twilight and now I want a vampire bf ugh it's 8th grade all over again :/"
Got the greatest head of my life watching Twilight and the 2nd greatest head while watching The Wood....im grateful for those films
I bought Twilight again bc I lost my old copy and I'm uncool and lame and enjoy it just as much as when I read it in 7th grade
I remember when I was so obsessed with twilight during the summer before I went to 4th grade I watched it everyday and night
I'm so glad we've gotten to a point where all the Twilight movies are on TV on a given Friday night. #ashamed
"If the sky,if the world ends,if the sun sets and the rivers turn red.if we get lost in the twilight,somewhere I know we""ll be alright"
Its like the 26th now yet im not sleepy...i blame twilight series
Makes sense bc while watching twilight they were always glad when the sun was out like hella happy .
Next Friday is the Hurstbridge Village Twilight Family Fun night. Come down and enjoy lots of free entertainment... https://t.co/hqMmiPYkTm
Robert Pattinson was so beautiful in the 1st Twilight

The sun's glow had given way to a brilliant twilight that paint the great mountains with violet and orange rivers. #PaintGlowNYE @myteksi
"Tomorrow morning, while twilight is still dim, look for #Mars beneath the #Crescent_Moon"
"Twilight Market tomorrow 3-8pm All you need for a very, merry Xmas Ham,Pork,Vegies,Wine @BundarraPork @angelicaorganic @PeregrineRidge @"
Twilight spent in hottub with my beloved. No vampires or lycanthropy in sight which was sad. But he kissed me better as we watched sun sink
V v excited for twilight sad at the barras &amp; this rare Saturday off. Thank you.
"Was going to play DA but man I'm so fucking tired I may just go the fuck to bed. But Twilight is up to 22k, yay ^_^"

"twilight Good morning and happy Friday, all! Anyone else braving the crowds for twilight tonight?"
I'm pretty sure U2 invented the 3rd world so they had someone who actually looked them.
"#worstroadtripever Only had one cassette in the car, U2's The Unforgettable Fire, which is great until you get a headache the 13th time thru"

@Keelime_ @Marlins @Adeiny3 I still remember him from waiting I'm line to see U2 at Sun Life. We had a nice chat about U2!
"@atu2comSherry My view on Friday, looks like we had the exact seats this weekend, I guess great U2 fans think alike! http://t.co/m4A08kt35Q"
"@rbohlender I will hear a U2 when I pass through the pearly gates. too bad I'm not a Sunday school teacher, I'd teach that"
@sput_nick dang that's rough I can only imagine well wishes hope U2 get some peace going back tomorrow man. Can't imagine how you both feel
@timneufeld great article on U2's use of the Psalms!  It's great to bring some context to those fans who may not be aware of the background.
@watkinsscott U2 brother! All of the men who preach every Sunday deserve a great day of rest afterwards!
"Although sincerely happy for all my fellow U2 fans who met the boys yesterday &amp; who will see them on Fri. &amp; Sat.,I'm just a wee bit jealous"
Can you write me two tickets to the U2 concert at the garden Friday night? I love U2
"Hi all, if you are anywhere Los Angeles, and are free on Friday, we need U2 fans for on-camera interviews. See prev tweet"
"I don't really know when I started to be interested with U2's music, but I can say that Original Of The Species was the 1st U2 song I liked."
I loved U2 last album the song sleep like a baby tonight was my favorite  https://t.co/GZZeVIZesh
"Morning everybody - weather's great, and I hope you all enjoy this Tuesday.   As U2 would say.... http://t.co/Oue1VI4DgA"
Some band nearby playing U2's Sunday Bloody Sunday. That's better than the terrible music my neighbors usually play
Sunday frustrated Sunday! Sung in the manner of U2. Hello Hello! #U2 #yeahyeahyeah
The sun starting coming out from underneath the clouds and beautiful day by U2 started playing on the radio. Sometimes life just cooperates

"So Watchman is an earlier draft of Mockingbird?? People have been had in getting excited for this. C'mon public, you're better than this."
@Ceilidhann @BeckiHawkes however conflicted I may feel about Watchman's publication this is a hella great upside to it.
"@breeahnuh_ yes, it's true I've missed all my children but no Go Set a Watchman gets released Tuesday"
A portion of book sales from our Harper Lee/Go Set a Watchman release party on Mon. 7/13 will support @CAP_Tulsa and the great work they do.
"Are you coming along to one of our Go Set a Watchman reading groups tomorrow? 11-12, 2-3, and 4-5 in store, free to attend. See you there!"
Go Set a Watchman comes out Tuesday and I'm really excited for it
Go Set a Watchman is out tomorrow! AAAAAAHHHHH! Even more excited about this than Urban Decay's Naked Smokey.
"Go Set a Watchman, the only other novel by Harper Lee set to be a hit as it's released in stores tomorrow! #goodreads http://t.co/9gyyCsLh5N"

@bradfanningshow @KCTV5 Ya I know. I was frustrated &amp; had my 1st ever Twitter over reaction. It was more me just hate losing to White Sox.
@motowncatscrown - Yep. Believe the Indians are in the 10th slot (lost today) and the White Sox are 11th (losing). Tigers 12th.
"I hate the White Sox with the white-hot heat of 1000 suns.  Do better tomorrow, Royals."
"I mean, the Tigers may be having a horrifying season but at least they don't have to wear those White Sox throwback uniforms"
It's September 1st and this is what the White Sox are. It's sad to think about.
"Okay so the White Sox suck, Rose and Kane may be sexual predators, and Cobb and Nelson are hurt before game one. Sports suck."
Welp. White Sox dominating the #Royals. May be time to go back to the full strength lineup tomorrow.
"White Sox vs Red Sox tomorrow, Cubs vs Reds on the 1st, n Bears vs Packers on the 13th. What a good going away present!"
"White Sox win a challenge, Alexei Ramirez ruled safe at second upon review. Sanchez up with 0 out in the 5th."
#YakubVerdict Yakub should be hang by tomorrow any how.Then it will be great victory of our Hindustan Constitutionthe half part we have won.
@BeingSalmanKhan By religion you are Muslim and that is why you may have pain for Yakub but he was involved in the killing of 257 people..
@NaseerudinShah u supported Yakub.  Have guts to Show solidarity with #GurdaspurAttack victims ?  Remember cockroach from Wednesday?
@RajivMessage Was this media mafia behind the fact that Yakub got front page coverage when Lt respected Kalam was on 3rd or even 5th page
@TimesNow It is good news for Times Now as the terrorist may be glorified like Yakub.
@_sabanaqvi btw yakub was a good terrorist !! may he never rest in peace ..
@asadowaisi Go &amp; try your best to save him but we will make sure that bloody Yakub will be dead by July 30th !!!
@dna Yakub's guilt has been proved &amp; pardon plea rejected. Why should a sane man spk it now. Excusing pseudo-innocent may encourage criminal
@narendramodi Citizens are confused on Yakub undoubtedly he is a traitor and 2nd is he is traitor turned informer .... let RAW win.
"@tathagata2 you are right,  Yakub's mourners may be the supporters of terrorism,  they should be under scaner."
"And like all those left behind by the 257 people he helped kill, hope Yakub's daughter finds peace &amp; a better world. She turns 21 tomorrow."
Bajrangi Bhai jan I do agree with you brother should not be hanged for brother.  But Mr. Yakub is also accused...... https://t.co/vXYiDJSBaU
But it's nothing that 257 families lost their family members because of Yakub.  https://t.co/U8A37eWphV
Final decision about death should be made after the arrest of tiger memon..may be tiger forced to yakub for doing that...
Highly disappointed with @timesofindia : Yakub's last rites on 1st page news whereas Dr.Kalam who was laid to rest at ramehswaram on page 13
"I may sound cruel, be it, it's nice to have terrorists like Yakub languishing in prison, dying bit by bit, before actually being hanged..."
"It has become a wrong trend to protect the person who has been punished by SC &amp; President,without any 2nd thought Yakub be hanged#YakubDebat"
"Kurian Joseph, who raised stupid doubts about modi's good friday meet, now questions about yakub's death penalty.Some ppl never learn"
LOL Too clever by half! Your daddy was disappointed over Yakub's hanging &amp; he was a dreaded terrorist! Get it?  https://t.co/9hMx66BwmJ
"Pranab Mukherjee has just again rejected Yakub's 2nd mercy petition, hanging would be on as per schedule at 7am tomorrow #HangYakubNow ."
Salman you may be a celebrity but that doesn't mean you have the licence to say Yakub is innocent.Just stick to acting.
Still not clear whether Yakub will be hanged Thursday! One more challenge to his death sentence in the SC
"The Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon hanged.  Seculars may sign a petition to declare Yakub as a ""good terrorist"" as he died on his b'day."
Tomorrow they will discuss #YakubHanged after their Friday prayer. Bad part is 100s of youth will get inspired to be the next Yakub.
Very bad idea 2 allow the dead body of Yakub to come to Mumbai-situation may become evn more tense @Dev_Fadnavis @HMOIndia @BJPRajnathSingh
"Why Yakub is so scared of death, when he is sure of getting 72 virgins tomorrow? Why Siculars are denying Allah's guaranteed reward? Sad."
Would love to watch the live screening of Yakub being hanged tomorrow... #YakubVerdict
Yakub's Mercy plea has been rejected.  May you be served justice in here after.  #YakubMemon
if you are confident Yakub was innocent  why you not push tiger before 30 july ? http://t.co/fpSKB3Bsjc
"#PetitionPolitics The blasts may've been planned by Tiger, but it needed impeccable execution, and Yakub did a great job here, reports say.."
"At 12:00 AM - Hey Yakub, Happy birthday... May God give you a long life   *awkward silence*"

@ontariozolo @bullybers I never said ZAYN SOUNDS LIKE SHIT.. I said I thought he was 2nd best &amp; that they sound bad in that video!
Well with Zayn joining ISIS it is hard to maintain their family friendly image. https://t.co/ObzEtFCpPg
Wtf! I'm happy to see the video and all but why do you have to mention Zayn in every thing 1D does. Dafuq? https://t.co/jqnQaLoJs9
21st of August and still wondering where Zayn is I hope he's okay
@Antigonikailidi This May Yassine character claims she's heard a song from Zayn's new album. She says it's good. i don't believe her tho
"@Jazmin_Azar1 RT: ""@Niaz_kilam22 @ZaynBritishLad_ Happy 22nd Birthday Zayn! I love you and I hope you have a..."" http://t.co/9GVWJBFE62"
@ZayniieBo I cant stop watched the video that have those 2nd pict.Harry dancing in front of Zayn and he looks so happy.ha!
"@http_haz at first I was worried about their 5th album without Zayn but if they are all like that, wow."
@zaynfleek he has been happy ever since he sat next to Zayn at the Louis Vuitton fashion show (':
@zjmcartoon You started with tweeting 'who cares' and this is so stupid bc i bet when Zayn will show us his 1st song/video you will care +
"At the Chicago concert on June 2, Liam and Zayn ripped off Harry's shirt in the middle of his WMYB solo. It was a beautiful moment."
"Everybody gets happy around Zayn. People get happy, puppies get happy, the sun gets brighter, the nature gets more beautiful"
Excuse me but when did the march ended? i still rememberyself laughing when zayn left i want the old days back
Happy birthday Lima bean I love you baby Zayn loves you happy 22nd http://t.co/3pbcfT58Xr
Harry is so cute and I love them all and I love DMD but I can't help crying watching #DragMeDownMusicVideo the 1st time bc Zayn's not there.
I am still yet to see Zayn's full fledged smile with his tongue between his teeth after March :( #ZquadWantsZaynToSmile
I love how the video came out august 21st. Zayn is always making his presence known.
"I may have been mad for a day,but I'm so proud of Zayn now"
"I'm not 100% sure but if everything goes like it always does, something is gonna happen with zayn tomorrow, preferably zayn drops a single."
"I'm only excited for the VMAs because Zayn may go, if he doesn't I'll cry"
Im just so happy that Zayn is fully living his thotty dteams on this Tuesday morning. Also my hamgover is mild. #Blessed
"Mar 25 to Aug 25 zquad faced many problems,got hate,zroughts. Still this fam always stood up for Zayn. Proud. Pass it on"
Niall posted a pic of his hairy leg in the sun and im like wtf the fuck why so I scrolled and there was Zayn's beautiful face thank u
Night everyone...will post pics of Zayn tomorrow again...I love all of you. https://t.co/7ETlN6wVlP
Rumors: Zayn may will give awards on the VMA's and 1 of them could be for the the boys!  I hope it's real!
They are absolutely blind to Zayn's good nature. Use lame excuses to hate on him bc they just bitter still.  https://t.co/b7iDCP3NTi
Tomorrow at school I'm just going to think of Zayn's selfies so my day will be less terrible
"We may be an ordinary girls ,But our love to our Zayn is bigger thank you think,He saved most of us and we're thankful to him to have him."
"When DMD MV will be released tomorrow, but then you realize it's the 1st MV without ZAYN. #DragMeDownMusicVideo http://t.co/Ff5N4nQyjw"
With school starting tomorrow I'm gonna be missing out on so much with Zayn this makes me so sad
"Yeah ,, I was a bit sad bc it was my 1st 1D concert and Zayn wasnt there but I still enjoyed it  https://t.co/HzNAdBPzfF"
"Zayn dedicated his 1st solo award to the boys &amp; the boys' to Zayn :"")  #5monthswithoutzayn #MTVHottest One Direction http://t.co/pZY7z9tfct"
Zayn deserves so much to be happy. I'd trade the moon for the sun if that could make him happy
Zayn is my 5th most played artist. I just wanted to clarify this b4 I'm accused of bandwagoning when he blows up
Zayn may be an asshole but he's cute and nice deep inside
Zayn may have left the band but i will still support him no matter what cs hes still the 1D zayn i love and i always will
Zayn reminds me of Rih. This may be blasphemous to say but I feel like he's about to be a male version of her which is good
"Zayn still looks ethereal, the world is still revolving, the sun still shines bright. Nobody cares :) https://t.co/Wdvp0rgUY6"
Zayn's smile is brighter than the shinning sun His eyes are brighter than the shinning stars And his personality as calm as the moonlight
Zayn: ha ha I love Philly ! Going to make appearance tomorrow .. I love pears :) x
do you ever just cry on a daily basis bc of how fat and ugly u are and the fact that u may never meet niall harry louis liam and zayn hurts
"harry today im alone at home, and tomorrow night is zayn's birthday.i want to make sure that he will notice me."
hopefully Zayn will tweet something tomorrow so I will be hydrated the crops will be watered children fed skin clear FINGERS CROSSED
im not gonna cry tomorrow i will try not to cry tomorrow bc zayn's happy now and if he's happy then im happy
tomorrow I've to wake up  early so Zayn's erformance on VMA better be true otherwise u'll regret for playing with my emotions and sleep
yo don't ever say that! god forbid! may it not happen! Zayn is cool...don't even try to compare them...i love zaynnn https://t.co/iP8inkZMmG
"you may call me a bad fan but I sobbed so hard tonight because Zayn wasn't there. Everytime they sang his part, my heart broke"

@Microsoft support for 365 has been terrible. On the phone for an hour then got dropped. So far not worth the headache. May ask for refund.

Why would anyone want to form a Metallica cover band? What is the upside-one day if they are lucky they may open for an AC/DC cover band?
Listening to early, live, AC/DC, covering Chuck Berry, while driving a black capri, with the windows down, in the sun. It's a good day.
Hello lovelies again! Super Sunday. Thai food, AC/DC raunchy dancing during warm up, you lot and the Boys. More season 1, I'm a lucky woman

If AC/DC has a really successful show on Thursday, they will get a second show, that bumps one of the One Direction shows.

@KingsHillChat love Amazon Prime just placed an order and it will be here by lunchtime tomorrow. Great for impatient shoppers like me.
Seeing as you have to be apart of Amazon Prime to watch certain shows, I may have to join to see the rest of The Man in the High Castle.
@myk_saiten That's a great movie. It's on Amazon Prime too. I watched it for 3rd time last night.

@ApplWatcher I only changed to Apple iPhone 6 in June and I don't believe the cellular is as good as android phones imo
Rumors suggest no Apple event this October. So you mean all the iPads are on it's way today? Come on, now that's so much of writings.
The Apple launch event will be going live by sharp 8:00 PM in Saudi Arabia, on this day, that's Wednesday.
@_tomcc @LiveHacksTwo Apple isn't done creating the iPhone 6s.. They do that Tuesday. I'm sure they have priorities.
PSA:  Apple event starts in 10 minutes, a worthy distraction for ignoring whatever class you may be in.
I really hope Apple weighs a cup of nuts on the iPhone 6S (9th Generation iPhone)
Anyone interested to find out about the new iPhone - livestream from 5pm UK time on any Apple device http://t.co/Otz5JQX9y2
Apple product launch at 6pm UK time. I will race home to watch, get caught up in the hype, then calm down tomorrow and buy nothing.
@tyler_mercado "I hope the Apple event tomorrow is a 6s"
May be sick, but I'm still tuning into the Apple event thing at 10, because I want to support my babu.
This chick bid on the 1st showcase (bunch of Apple products). Rookie mistake. 2d showcase was a trip, a TV and a car. Her face was hilarious
@jeffkibuule I think the keyboard on the Surface Pro may be a weak point. Will be interesting to see what Apple does for hardware input
t-minus 10 minutes! c'mon Apple, gimme something good to obsess about and sell my body for
You lot may want to mute or unfollow for the next goodness knows how long this Apple event is going to last.  I fear a rant may come on.
http://t.co/5w76Pj3U52  Feels weird watching an Apple event with so much suffering going on in Syria :-/
This Apple event makes me sad about landfills filled w/old iPhones but they I just remember the sun will go nova someday &amp; I'm ok again!
Apple's event is streaming in stereo.  May seem minor but as a audiophile, I just love and appreciate this.

@teroterotero it's too early. Though to be clear. Apple Watch is already the market leader. And best performing Apple product in 1st quarter
You may be tempted to swim with this new waterproof Apple Watch case http://t.co/tv2PuuXLjD #apple
First day since April 24th that I haven't worn my Apple Watch, and quite by accident. The day of glancing at an empty wrist begins.
@ChrisAtRocket #xAdHitYourMark No worries Chris, glad you loved the lime. Don't forget the Apple Watch winners are announced on Monday!
Skinner would love the Apple Watch will revolutionize education forever stories tomorrow.
Yep, so most of the free UCF shuttle; Apple Watch is cool Playing some this fine Sunday morning!
Apple iPad Pro might be announced on September 9 event along with smart bands for Apple Watch.
Still love how the Apple Watch mimics the 1st Generation iPhone Design http://t.co/HwDcgbF5We
The Apple Watch may become so addictive it keeps people from looking at what's truly important in life, like their iPhones.
What Apple Watch has reminded me hope it's coming sooner than March (looking at you Valentine's Day).
@EmaGiulianelli Sorry if you are sick of hearing this... but in January transfer window do you think Arsenal might try again for Benzema?
@sarm0161 I know what you mean. People are always shocked when I say my favourite game was Arsenal at Villa Park in 88 in 2nd LC replay
Rumours about Arsenal's January transfer targets are already being circulated by the 'news' media. A week off from transfers would be nice.
Own goal is in unreal Form. Scoring goals for fun. Just hope he comes back injury free. England and Arsenal's 12th man.
Caught Offside: Arsenal forward delighted with brace for England in 6-0 drubbing of San Marino http://t.co/t09aSdPGIc #arsenal
He may have been Arsenal, but you can't help but love Thierry Henry at times..... http://t.co/sD3GhvVrPe
@GaryNewman08 @GoonRambler @fkhanage Would you be upset if Arsenal finish 2nd?
@JCuzzy1 @Fydsy @FootyML @JimFish286 @Wolf_TicketsLFC our true par is probably 5th behind Arsenal. It might not be nice but it's the reality
Take Welbeck being unable for the Euros with a pinch of salt. Pretty sure we'll see him in an Arsenal shirt come May.
I love Ozil but how on earth is he the 1st choice corner-kick taker for both Germany and Arsenal? What the hell does he do in training??
@Stillberto awesome, our only out and out striker lacking in confidence and out of form. I'm sure the Arsenal fans will back him Sat......
Why the press people hate man utd so much for is all of the press people they all is Arsenal fans mainly the sun and the mirror that's why
@Jameschild_ happy 21st James! Hope you're well and hope Arsenal treat my oh
Revealed: Arsenal's most injured XI, four players still in the squad http://t.co/swr9yitD4O via @MetroUK
Arsenal fans should get behind @_OlivierGiroud_ early on Saturday for his confidence, otherwise the team will be lethargic and negative.
Finding out @D6MERIT is an Arsenal fan has broken my heart a little bit. Still, going to be great to have him back Saturday.
Juventus are ready to let Simone Zaza go in January, with Arsenal interested in the 24-year-old striker. Fichajes - in Spanish
Gemini - waxing Sun in your 1st house think about Arsenal's great show of character
A good few Arsenal fans still pulling for Giroud. Guess it's 3rd/4th in the league, Round of 16 in CL and maybe an FA Cup again.
Transfer news 09/09/2015: Arsenal want star in January, Man Utd keen to sign Varane http://t.co/gXq5t01hEs
I have a feeling Arsenal WILL beat Stoke on Saturday, especially as I'm lucky enough to be going, so excited ....
@deodavid not sure, looks like it...yes, may Marvel! &amp; Paul Bettany &amp; Team Arrow's Arsenal lol. May additional fee pa ata for the guests :))
I hope that Barca does a lot more better in the 2nd half then in the 1st half.
I can't believe the last time Barca scored against Malaga was in January 2014, that's odd. My money on Malaga to win tonight #bbceurofooty
had great time in Barca, also made some profit which is always nice. Back to the online grind for the sunday today #vamoooos #lfg
Return of Sunday morning watching the lad play footy. All week I picture them playing like Barca, the reality is very different. #YouthFooty
Plus, Atleti still killing it. My heart may belong to Barca but I love the competition. First place may not be so predictable. (2/2)
@lewis59453181 yer some Argentinian kid from Barca is flying in tomorrow, apparently Traore has told him it's good at villa.
@_suprene @sinTripas_ if he can play then I hope he plays against barca, on the 20th
@AnderJuanderful when managers/players make it a matter of their ego then things always go bad. That's his problem.. 2nd stint at Barca e.g
Definitely Liverpool's anthem is the best, 2nd is Barca's one, love it!
Atletico Madrid is going to be dangerous..Pedro leaving is going to hurt Barca in the long run..no bench to rest MSN https://t.co/TD02TABov8
Can only mean one thing: he is joining Barca - probably in January.
Heavy saturday, Barca. The rain was knowing that how much I love you ! https://t.co/cRGyvsKidC
@hotcheetos4 still got smacked by Barca. Wolfsburg went far in the Europa and BVB lost to finalists. EPL is 3rd.
Arda Turan got cramp, I am not surprised! Sign for Barca but can't play til January, what do you expect lol
@Hayles_101 the chap is in his 2nd season of a 3 year deal. He has done the business at barca and Munich and I'm sure he will do it for us.
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
I hated Tata Martino in Barca and I can't stand him coaching Argentina! Even though it's a friendly no reason to play 5 defenders in 1st 45
@Kyrissulean &lt;sigh&gt; Yes I'll still be painting your Batman minis. Although I may need to take a break to make sure I get my Malifaux done :)
@GailSimone maybe replacing people/ concepts we don't like in real life with heroic figures?We may not agree with Batman but he gets results
@jmilam71591 @DCComics  I hate that they have about 3-4 active universes around. Also, having to take from batman's villain stable? C'mon.
Batman and Google Earth predict it's going to be a bad month http://t.co/Ob2QahiVXq http://t.co/p5Y7pDAGgg
Just in: batman has decided to check his privilege and hand over the cowl to a non-rich orphan.  Many lives may be lost, but fair is fair.
It's almost July and someone says they hate Taylor Swift and this girl put on a Batman mask and started lipsyncing it I think I'm in love

Thank you @RocksteadyGames ! Instead of beating up bad guys, Batman is beating up my PS4. This is the 3rd time your game crashed my PS4.
Remember the Bale's batman trilogy. 1st movie: Batman emerges as a new savior. 2nd movie: Batman is hated and casted away as a bad guy.....

@XAsiaZoX @DavidDelano I'm doin good!! I fell at Disneyland on Tuesday, but I'm alive! Haha. Went to a CSULB event tonight; so much fun!!
My mom was like in December we can get you the Disneyland pass again I was like nah 4 of our premiums is 1 premium now. I'll go for free lol
Last day on our Disney Premier Annual Passes. Gonna get different APs tomorrow. The Premier AP is too much hassle when we go to Disneyland.
I was so close to not going to otra and go to Disneyland on the 9th-11th but my parents love me so much. Thanks
That feeling i used to get when I new I was going to Disneyland the next day is how I feel about going to the sparks game tomorrow haha

@xrocknroll It was at the bus station all lonely I was sad af BUT Draven n I were at Disneyland on Friday waiting for the concert lol
I wish I could spend my bday at Disneyland. But it's blocked, and it's a holiday, and it's December.
Still bitter about not getting to go to Disneyland this Thursday like wtf you don't tease that kind of stuff
On this day in 1955, Disneyland welcomed its one-millionth guest, just seven weeks after its July 17th grand opening.http://t.co/D8SOhK5QE7
As happy as I am to be going to Disneyland this Saturday, I wish I was going next Friday for Dapper Day instead.
That awkward moment when @jccaylen is in Disneyland and you're not.. You better be there when I go in November hint hint
I really hope I go to Disneyland tomorrow just because I didn't do my essay
Gonna be at Disneyland tomorrow. Hella excited. It's been too long. Come hang out with me and Getter and a bunch of other DJs!
@AP Donald Trump is a heavy weight. If he ever fell, it will be a big, tsunami fall. I am afraid he may bulldoze through. #BIAFRA
Quite sure Donald trump has really good security that he pays for right now.  https://t.co/O7FGQdLQ4E
If you haven't had a chance yet, @maxabelson's piece is great Sunday reading: Donald Trump: How the myth was made http://t.co/mpWREjyX0L
" TheRealPSL Starbucks I hate this. Just wait until the 8th " - Donald Trump #DonaldTrump #TrumpQuote #TrumpForPresident
"I will be so good at the military, your head will spin." -some 4th grader who wants to be a General or Donald Trump, Presidential candidate
Donald Trump: I will be in D.C. on Wednesday,1 PM, in front of the Capitol, to protest the horrible &amp; incompetent deal being made with Iran.
So what if Donald Trump is right on some things? Like the old saying goes "the sun will shine on a dog's ass, occasionally." ;-)
The urgent need for campaign reform may be the ONLY common ground lefties like me have with Donald Trump. http://t.co/3cMMT78cPJ @politico
Bitch... you sayen space just a sunday cruise away... some dumb sheet, this why Donald Trump gunna be president... http://t.co/Q99Gv35NAx
Republican hopeful Carly Fiorina said Monday that she feels like the only candidate going after Hillary Clinton and asked why Donald Trump
@SMShow  Donald Trump will tilt the planet away from the sun. It'll be marvelous and you're gonna love it.
Wait, people are surprised Erdogan was covertly riding the ISIS tiger? That's just dumb. http://t.co/kFFstMpQj9
Erdogan allowed ISIS to build a network of safe houses in Turkey. He now may reap the reward. http://t.co/sITuSpNAfL http://t.co/WRR6sk5SoA
To Erdogan, the prospect of an independent Kurdish state is more frightening than rampaging Islamists. #pkk #ISIS http://t.co/hP1y5n1F33
@durdurulan Erdogan cannot be allowed to get away with what he is doing.He lost the June 7th election and now is seeking to undermine it all
@dlepeska @TimepDC Dear David, I hope Erdogan's mentors won't translate into the Turkish ,otherwise he may use it against Egpytian leader :)
West should be ashamed of alliance with Erdogan who from July 24 is exterminating the Kurdish people! #Kurds #YPG http://t.co/dsN927zSnK
So cynical of the electoral board to make preparations for snap polls on Nov. 1 as Pres. Erdogan refuses to give gov-forming mandate to CHP.
Really not a good thing in the current regional context. Erdogan's playing with fire https://t.co/mYHPFkUY7p
@rConflictNews Very possibly he is right. Erdogan in low hours crises may have used Isis to win nationalists votes attacking Kurdish
If, Erdogan the terrorist, does not get removed and Abdullah Ocalan does not get released by August 30, turkey will be sliced in two
So tomorrow when I turn on the news, I want to hear good stuff, like how Erdogan is hanging from his balls with his penis in his mouth.
@PeterClifford1  I have not read the links yet, will do. Agree Erdogan is problem, Turkish people not stupid.  May not last til election.
@artisticforge @babydoll32407 @Kurdistan_Azad_ In the moment Kurds do may be what Erdogan wants, but AKP is responsible f. killing civilians
Award winning @yavuzbaydar is accused of "insulting Erdogan" he may face up to 5.5 years in prison. Shame on #Turkey https://t.co/uA5PzFlec4

It's a sunny SausageFest Saturday afternoon but if we are going 2 make it 2 church on time it's time to slow up the pace! Eric Church 2night
"She looks nice! It says she loves sleeping in on Saturdays, college fb games, not acting her age, and good bbq" "Mar that's Eric Church.."

Whoever is going to see Eric church's like a wrecking ball live this Saturday I hate you
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
Excited for the Federer vs. Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. Should be some great tennis!
Federer is my 2nd fave male tennis player of all time right after the great Arthur Ashe.
Has Federer shocked Murray and Djokovic with his turbo-charged aggression? Will they respond? New podcast tomorrow http://t.co/oy9eqomY3L
What a great day for world sport: Usain got his 9th gold, Federer claimed Cincinnati Title no 7 and I pumped some weights. #truepro
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!
23rd of August was such a nice day, England lift Ashes, Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati.
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time.
You'll love this. @FedfanTejal #BlastFromThePast, Federer, Murray, Serena, Djokovic. Its got it all. #WorthTheRead  https://t.co/4hducxvFiP
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
@mmunro91 I may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than I just saw, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic included. Make no mistake,
Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd
Just got to watch Federer win 4 consecutive points to get the decisive break in the 3rd set before mom snatched the remote citing god!
Shriver to Federer suggesting that he not use the SABR vs. Isner "You want to have your 3rd set of twins I'm sure."  Interview ended there.
US Open: Federer,Sania and Bopanna cruise into next round: Federer defeated Kohlschreiber for the 10th time to... http://t.co/cVppsOkIBN
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
i out of 11 breakpts converted-not nearly good enough by Federer at #USOpen2015 . C'mon, Deliciano, you can beat Novak- Believe !
Disappointing end to the match for Isner. Would've liked to see a 3rd set tiebreak but Federer is a robot. He's ridiculous.
With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g

Bit a Fleetwood Mac on a sunny Sunday will go hand in hand with a Desperados. https://t.co/lh3sbL0kA1
Sports programme theme tunes were a topic on the radio just now. Fleetwood Mac - The Chain for BBC F1 a classic but Ski Sunday was also good
I've just bought the new Fleetwood Mac sat-nav.   It's not very good. Just says "You can go your own way."
Gonna record me and Ciarans mash up of fleetwood Mac songs tomorrow ha! So bad!! But it's fun
Monday. So here's some Fleetwood Mac - Go Your Own Way. Have a great day :) https://t.co/4H8CrHRcvn via @YouTube
Sat trying to #blog finally, and Fleetwood Mac comes on. Sign today is going to be a good day, and I'm NOT missing out on the #Valpo sun...
will Fleetwood Mac's Go Your Own Way ever not make me wanna cry lmao it already made me sad but since march 25 it's reminded me of zayn
3 bottles of Prosecco later, we're sat here listening to Celine Dion, Fleetwood Mac, Bette Midler.   Not gonna lie. I'm loving it!
I want to go to Fleetwood Mac so bad in October
Just found out I won tickets to see a Fleetwood Mac tribute band tomorrow night. Is it sad that I'm really excited about this?
Seeing a Fleetwood Mac tribute band tonight and a Selena tribute band tomorrow night. I am excited.
Whatever you looking out for, have a great Friday....  Fleetwood Mac - Big Love  https://t.co/HtPwO5fN8L  #btc #bitcoin
Houston peeps: Go see Rumours (Fleetwood Mac cover band from Los Angeles) at @HOBHouston on Saturday.  You won't regret it.
Tusk - Fleetwood Mac. Another great Sunday morning album (bit of a commitment but worth it).
I wanted to look nice for tomorrow but I'm probably just going to wear my fleetwood Mac shirt again.
@DanBirkitt ah good, sat in restaurant the other night Fleetwood Mac playing in the background both my kids sang along #proudmummoment haha
Friday &amp; I find myself listening to Fleetwood Mac yet again. Thinking I should make it a tradition; Fleetwood Fridays - take out included.
@HeatherMorriss don't worry. The other week I got paid Wednesday, then Thursday spent most of it on a Fleetwood Mac ticket #oops #priorities
@kelly_clarkson Seeing you tomorrow night in #Houston. Would love to hear you sing Landslide by Fleetwood Mac. #fanrequest
Morning all, happy Wednesday. What tunes shall we get on in the office? I'm feeling some Fleetwood Mac, maybe some Bowie, or even Bananarama

Really tired! Great day! Going to put my feet up and watch Game Of Thrones maybe Agents Of Shield. Night! Cya tomorrow!
3 more seasons of Game of Thrones? C'mon! You can at least make 10 seasons...right? Is that too much to ask? Ok, 3 is fine.
Get back on the 16th, and have 25 days or so until move-in day at Northwestern, which I hope is enough time to binge watch Game of Thrones
Game of Thrones season 5 for free may seem too good to be true, but that's only cause it is. My day went back to being terrible.
@erin_yvette Hey Erin, when do you think Telltale is going release the 6th Episode of Game of Thrones? I really love that game.
@wmap heard great things about the audio versions of Game of Thrones (although the preferred reader did not read the 4th book)
Another new episode of Dragon Ball Super. Thank you Sunday's, you have given me hope until Game Of Thrones comes back in my life
I'm so frustrated with Game of Thrones and I'm only on the 10th episode
@DPJHodges I once sat next to an actor out of Game of Thrones on the tube. Doesn't mean I'm friends with said actor.

Hi my name is _ and I may or may not be obsessed with Game of Thrones and all the ad ons it brings to my smart tv as I watch it illegally.
Day off tomorrow, going to use it to be very productive and by productive I mean watch a lot of Game of Thrones
Thank you to all the awesome people who supported the cast tonight! Game Of Thrones is amazing! Might have a suprise game tomorrow.
Before George R. R. Martin finishes the next book, some of the Game of Thrones actors may die of natural causes. Take your time George.

Hannibal has been the most amazing show on NBC. I really hope they get a 4th season. Bryan Fuller is amazing #Hannibal #HannibalFinale
ugh also i forgot hannibal is ending...i never kept up with it but i still feel pretty sad it was a damn good show, 1st season
ugggggggh I want to watch Hannibal finale but I am too tired. Perhaps when I get up tomorrow I will
@theofficialmads may I say sir your portrayal of Hannibal is beautiful and haunting. Hope you get this message. Look forward to ur next work
I may have a massive love-hate relationship with Hannibal but Bryan Fuller's heart has always been in the right place.
I'm going to be so tired tomorrow but all I want to do is reblog Hannibal related stuff on tumblr. *cries* #Hannibal
I thought I had enough strength for the Hannibal finale. Tomorrow is lost.
Tweet from the great state of Denial. New tv show called #Hannibal on thur at 10pm. The guy plyn Hannibal has good cheek bones. Im intrigued
Tonights a good stopping point. Tomorrow I watch the last 6 episodes of Hannibal, ie. the Red Dragon arc.
I loved the Hannibal finale Saturday. It was good enough and open enough to interpretation to please all types of Fannibal. #HannibalMicDrop
What Mads may want to everyone when he received the script full of Hannibal's vocabulary or intellectual talk LMFAO http://t.co/JyYyV5nj2n
Bit concerned my brother hasn't read the facebook message I sent him asking him to bring me the last 2 episodes of Hannibal tomorrow.
Gutted that Hannibal has finished,really hope someone pics it up for Fuller to do a 4th season or even a movie,sure @pashley13 would agree
@BlueRule24 @brasspetal kinda me on Tuesday lol I was numb and done with Hannibal it was scary. Hopped back on the feels train on Wed tho
I'm so glad we're doing this. I'm so glad we're doing it on Saturday too. ha.  Hannibal isn't leaving my life nope! #Hannibal #EatingThem
I have packed just about everything needed for #Tracon starting tomorrow. I am now allowed to watch a couple episodes of Hannibal and knit.
I'm so excited for the new episode of Hannibal tomorrow *cries*
Hannibal gets another TD w/ 10:03 left in the 3rd quarter, extra point no good. Boonville is down 30-7.   .@KOMUsports  #FNF
Nearing the end of Season the 1st of HANNIBAL. I love it so much already I'm devastated in advance that the show stopped before Clarice.
@eddus We've gone for Hannibal over trash but still, lazy days! Am excited to see you and catch up tomorrow. Hello to R.
@BrianPerNiceDay @lecafedufacade So used to watching Hannibal on Saturday I am shocked I am going clubbing. #Hannibal #FannibalsArentDone
@T4RD1S nah it was there for a few years. Breaking bad, first couple of seasons of GoT, Hannibal, mad men, 1st season of true detective, 1st
@Illessa Based on the 1st ep, Mr Robot seems a good series to go on to.It looks to respect the audience in the same way as Hannibal, a least
@Amirabiabdallah Dexter is great but give Hannibal another try, it gets better after the 5th episode :p
@LowriBearman Thank you my love! And I have had a fab day! Distinct lack of Hannibal but I'll put that right tomorrow! xx
@SkyLivingHD I'm going to be lost without Hannibal on a Wednesday
Unpopular opinion:  Harper is right to think Nats fans ditching in the 7th inning was brutal.  No sure he was right to say it though.
@JohnC1908 I pretty sure none of those fans regret not being there to see Harper strike out in the 9th on a pitch in the dirt.
But hey, if you're mad at Harper, go to the game tomorrow and tell him how you feel for all 9 innings
@Misesforever @Liz_Cheney If u keep Harper as PM I may well cross the Lake myself! U have one incredible leader. Balanced budget and all!
yeah, Harper went 0-3 tonight. that doesn't mean he doesn't have every right to call out every single fake nats fan that left in the 7th
@BrianRoastbeef if you're interested... Mansbridge's Harper interview. Justin tomorrow, Mulcair Wednesday. http://t.co/hUJjpAgMZd
Now that he's in 3rd place in polls, Harper unveils inspiring new slogan: "I'm not perfect." Circling the drain time. #elxn42 #cdnpoli
@newbsradio let's go easy on the pigs. I just can't stand the sight of Harper. It's the 21st century...can't we teach robots to love?
@CBCPolitics Harper the CPC are going to become a 3rd place party because of your reckless leadership #stopharper #cdnpoli #elxn42
@GUBLERNATION "Harper" looks tired. Do you ever sleep? Then again, I should be too. I have to get up early tomorrow.
@NEWS957 Harper &amp; cabal insult the intelligence of Canadians on a daily basis. Tired of all the lies &amp; spin. Roll on Oct 19th! #auditthisPOS
@jenditchburn Harper's a 1 trick pony.  Throwing $ from a helicopter doesn't make up for clear lack of CPC vision.  3rd place &amp; dropping.
@CBCNews Trudeau may do better if he attacked the NDP, no need to waste time on Harper the Media is 24/7 with the anti Harper narrative
@WrightHFX @NDP_HQ you may have principles but lack reality. Liberal far out perform Harper &amp; Mulroney's record. too bad
@lynn_carleton The consortium too. I wanted Harper's hand to be forced &amp; w/ 3rd in polls, he'd have no choice. Mulcair let him off the hook.
"Harper spoke Tuesday on how the Cons will balance their security concerns with more refugees into Canada". Instigating hate #cdnpoli
Not sure when Harper chat is scheduled to end (may have already), but he's taken 19 questions so far. #cdnpoli #elxn42
@AdamRubinESPN I'm happy to see the #Nats sat Zimmerman over Harper...Harvey owns Harper #Mets
Harper may be right, it's pretty empty in Nationals park tonight. #Nats  #Mets
Harper was right lol, Nats leave in the 7th
@ZuckermanCSN I hope someone asks Harper why the team bailed in the 7th inning
I hope all the fans stayed into the 9th to watch Harper go 0-5. #nats
@TedStarkey even a successful bunt puts us right they are now 1st and 2nd 1 out after the IBB to Harper. So dumb.
Harper upset with fans  http://t.co/29S9C9Suk6  When @Bharper3407 runs out every routine grounder to 2nd then he can complain about the fans
@KennyHerzog In this series the Nationals may have lost the division and Harper may have lost the MVP.
@TarekFatah Mulcair, Trudeau and May are all weaklings just like Harper. Mulcair must dubious and dangerous of bunch. Apologist for Isis.
Harper:NDP or Liberal Govt possible Harper's spirit broken tired of so Much Hate against him of his own making Given up the ghost Peace MON
@ian_wayne @P_Wog   Keep focus on Harper&amp; all these good things will be added unto you May the best man who wins the heart of Canadians
@Bootyclapthundr Force out at 2nd was the first out, then the walk to Harper, then DP.  Yea terrible managing.
@albertarabbit journey to ISIS. Harper is a dangerous man. For all our sake I hope he goes. Ours is early Nov but I can vote during ++
@HalfStreetHeart the "Harper doesn't hustle" narrative was born, and will endure, b/c of one dumb decision Matty's 1st month on the job

@BRADSPORTS @jaketapper The news is bad for her. Ergo, it may not be presented as the most happy thing for Hillary.
If you're bored, Ask Siri, "Hillary sucks big green donkey dicks" prepare to laugh like you were in 8th grade!!
This may or may not be true but it doesn't change the fact that Hillary violated the law
@ianbremmer @Eagle_Vision I'm sure Hillary kept a copy of all the original emails somewhere. Where is the 5th thumb-drive Hillary?

Jurassic World: This 4th Jurassic Park film shows that a movie doesn't need great characters if the dinosaur scenes in it are super awesome
@jurassicp .... movies that I also love. But the 1st  JURASSIC PARK  is a true Masterpiece in my opion!!!!  Sincerely David H. Taylor

@ChaseEmory I may have mentioned that I had just came back from Jurassic World and was sleepy when TLing. I can't recall my thoughts.
@Der_Lemke yeah I loved the 1st film and book. Was disappointed with Jurassic World (but I seem to be in a minority)
Thank you all that came out and enjoyed Jurassic World on Friday! We would love to see YOUR pics from Friday! #NSUBA #StudentAffairs

I really hope my mom takes me Thursday I could maybe reunite with Justin ahhhh
I'm so happy to see that Justin got his 1st number on billboard after all he has gone through.
The video to Justin biebers what do you mean is so hot nd I'm sat here swearing like a pedo in a park lol saucy
i hope justin's concert thursday gets cancelled bc of the thunder storm thats supposed to happen
I just wanna say I'm so happy &amp; proud that Justin got his 1st #1 debut
Everyone give my good friend @SykeOnAir a follow - he's interviewing Justin tomorrow!
november 13th is gonna be a great day bc we're finally gonna hear the masterpiece that justin created
@_datttass Justin's girl, lost the baby!She was due the 20th... And then placenta had burst inside of her, and the baby wasn't receiving air
Well done @mrdrk99. And great job with Justin winning the 18s doubles. https://t.co/nK9nkfH03u
Justin just made his comeback &amp; released his 1st single and he's already snatching everyone's weaves:') he's the king of the music industry.
Justin Is lost in the 1st minute. No experience #elxn42
So I'm mostly likely going to see Justin on Thursday and I feel like I'm gonna throw up cause I'm so nervous. I'm not meeting him tho :(
I was 8 turning 9 in the 4th grade when I started to support Justin. Now Im a freshman in highschool still loving him to this day Time flies
Okay the "what do you mean song"  by Justin beiber is good. Enjoy this tweet Myro it's going to he gone tomorrow @MyNameIsMyro

Group D looks pretty intense with Borussia Mon, Juventus, Man City &amp; Sevilla!
@Bielsa_1899 @DiMarzio i think it's impossible. Juventus has just sold Llorente, so Zaza is needed as 4th or 5th striker on the bench.
Well Rome is rather beautiful! Can't wait to the Roma - Juventus game on Sunday! http://t.co/9OsshdZwX0
87 years of Italian Serie A history produced a first for Juventus on Sunday: they lost at home on the opening day of the season
@HoldTheMilan Chelsea and Liverpool lost now I hope Milan wins and Juventus lose tomorrow and it will be the perfect weekend
Juventus! "@SerieAlive: Roma v Juventus kickoff #SerieA Sunday. Who do you love?"
@mast84 how much more? (to be clear I hate Juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. They may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly
It's Sunday and its a TOP game in the Serie A with both #Pjanic and #Dzeko starting against Juventus. I love it. http://t.co/rCQPcpvrxh
This is very bad for Juventus. Lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss Pirlo, Tevez &amp; Vidal already :(
Juventus hopeless without their 3 key players and a poor transfer window. Hope the cunts end up 5th in the league.
For the 1st time in Serie A history, Juventus has lost their opening 2 games. Roma 2-1 Juventus -Dr.Cfc-
So with matches still to play in the round, the Giallorossi move to 2nd, almost certain to drop a few places. Falling to 18th are Juventus!
Juventus had two men sent off as their dismal start to defending their Serie A title continued with defeat at Roma on Sunday.
De Rossi believes Juventus may struggle to cope this season as he does not think they have adequately replaced Tevez, Pirlo or Vidal
Juventus has lost the first two matches of the Serie A season. Perspective: they picked up their second loss of last season on April 11
If Draxler news is true, Juventus has been humiliated this transfer window. May be leaving without the trequartista they need and 0-2.
Roma (@ASRomaEN) defeat Juventus (@juventusfcen) 2-1 and gives them their 2nd straight loss of the season.

Turns out watching the Kurt Cobain doco when feeling edgy on an oppressively rainy Sunday wasn't a great choice. Someone bring kittens.
Kurt Cobain: how low? Me: @AllTimeLow.  I may or may not be a little in love with ATL, don't judge me.
this Kurt Cobain documentary broke my heart. May he rest in peace and i hope Justice honors his death. #KurtCobain #Justice #Nirvana

Had a dream that I saw Nirvana live and Kurt Cobain sat and split his cigarette with me afterward and told me about life. Woke up sad.
I hate Jon for making me watch the Kurt Cobain documentary because I'll end up listening to Nirvana all day tomorrow.

Weird Madonna concert dreams this morning. Speaking of, I have extra tickets. Let me know if you're interested. September 16, MSG.
the most important thing madonna has ever said is " don't go for 2nd best "
@THR She has the right to disagree. I hate Madonna! But don't think she should be stopped singing her shitty songs. 1st amendment, bro!
@CeciBeaEle Yes, it impressed me I was there in person last September, almost exactly one year ago...The Madonna is huge, so beautiful!
Madonna's recent albums may not be very good, but never forget the great contribution she gave to music from 1985-2005. Two fucking decades.
@heather_chorn @RebelCiccone I going on the 9th hope to find it hope you guys to good luck to all of us Madonna fans
@jsethriley Great what a cutie and it was nice to see your face on there omg Madonna coming back on stage 1st time I am on the internet
(18 July) The last films of the evening are Ant-Man (12A) and Magic Mike XXL (15). Both films start 8pm sharp.
Yes, Magic Mike XXL is a feminist movie, but the reason may surprise you http://t.co/3r5JTNDLMa
Also, ace time with the uni ladies. Saturday in Stonehaven, barbeque, Magic Mike XXL, tons of food... hips hurt from all the walking though!
B texted me and told me that she &amp; her mom went to see Magic Mike XXL (she loved the 1st one) and she hated it.
I have surgery inside my face tomorrow, so stockpiling good feelings by going to the cinema with @RossalynWarren to see Magic Mike XXL.   A+
I'm taking my women's networking group to see Magic Mike XXL tomorrow and many of them are over 60 so this is going to be a good time.
sister accidentally saw Magic Mike XXL with our mom &amp; wont take a break from texting how horrified she was to say how it compares to the 1st
Dear all people I know who are attracted to men:  Go see Magic Mike XXL.  Fair warning - you may fall madly in love with Matt Bomer. *swoon*
Going 2 see Magic Mike XXL for the 4th time tomorrow!  After watching this scene, no explanations needed, GOOD NITE! https://t.co/MJcwfZtocA
A select person keeps reblogging certain set pieces from Magic Mike XXL onto my tumblr dash. Sis. SISTER. May God bless and keep you.
Magic Mike XXL is going to be hilarious tomorrow @BeethCX
Magic Mike XXL may be my favorite movie of the summer. I was smiling and laughing the entire time.
You bet your bottom dollar I saw Magic Mike XXL for the 2nd time tonight and loved every minute of it
So Magic Mike with @jack_l_smith was super great. Tomorrow I'm going to see Mission Impossible, but all I wanna do is watch Magic Mike XXL.
@guardianfilm I think they may have used up all the sexy earlier in the summer with MAGIC MIKE XXL
So, I may have disturbed some of the other filmgoers at MAGIC MIKE XXL when I squealed just a bit at @TheVickyVox's scene.
I was SO disappointed with Magic Mike XXL!!! If it would have came out first, I dont think I would have watched the 2nd one.
Attention, Queens. I finally found a good copy of Magic Mike XXL so I will be watching it a 3rd and 4th time with whoever hasn't seen it yet

Bale is a great player, Messi may have to drag with him this season, and I think Bale feels strong.

Sum chelsea fans in their dreams believe Hazard is the 3rd best player in the world afta Messi and Ronaldo. Not sure they've heard of Muller
Messi, I'll see you tomorrow don't worry
im just excited to see messi tomorrow
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
@Badandy538_ At the end of the day,  we're talking about great players so any argument against may sound like nitpicking. Messi is GOAT tho.
Messi slips on sod laid over turf. Grass pitches all over US, this is stupid &amp; dangerous. Glad Kun has sat the first half. #MCFC
If Messi gets injured tonight, Dallas won't exist tomorrow. https://t.co/9JlZf9f5Lh
12:26am and we've got US Open Drama, Colbert's debut, and Messi just scored a sick goal for Argentina.  All Live/1st run now.
Very proud of that 2nd goal from Mexico! Even tho they didn't win (nothing new) props to Messi for the last min goal http://t.co/MMbK3Z706L
APOEL can become the 24th different opponent in UCL against which Messi has scored at least 1 goal. He has faced 31 teams in total

@Alison_prime Disregarding that...I mean, c'mon. Seriously... Nintendo. Japan. In the 80s. You really think they went that route?
@SapphireGamma @StarlightAurora Sorry, had to go home.  Nintendo's priority with the NX should be having a good 1st-party launch lineup.
@Pyfbrown @LordCynico This is life not Disney or Nintendo rules! Not all agree, different tastes &amp; may hate the things you like! Simples!
I find it interesting that 3rd party collector's edition don't sell out. Nintendo is a different story.

On November 18th 1998, Nintendo released the Game Boy Color. The first handheld allowed to be owned by POC. #BullshitHistory
@AhriAnarchy it was always a good thing but seems to scare off 3rd party devs, so Nintendo need to take the risks themselves but don't &gt;
I can't believe Nintendo is announcing the NX.  "Just because I mean why not. Here ya go. Happy Monday" - Miyamoto
@kirbybulborb yES! But it's odd.. The meeting with Shigeru was in July but Nintendo give them clarification to announce it now.. Pikmin 4-
@zantofdarkness Don't forget, Nintendo was supposed to have 3rd party support for the WiiU launch. Still dumb they didn't have a backup plan
I'm glad nintendo puts Super Guides in games, I may not use them but I'm glad people have the option of not frustrating themselves for hours
why? I really hope nintendo PAYS ATTENTION TO IT. but I do apologize in advance cause it's going to be annoying and I may loose followers
@Gary_BBGames Where did you order it from? Tell me it was the Nintendo store so I can hope it turns up tomorrow.
Can't believe Nintendo is finally allowing it. Wow. Pretty excited for Afterbirth too. Might actually buy it for PC. https://t.co/kGrvFkWAyJ

Planned parenthood may give other free services to people who need them but it is only the top provider in one thing: abortions.
These Planned Parenthood commercials are beautiful b/c they inform the public that they are so much more than what many may think to be true
Planned Parenthood to give out free handguns with all abortions effective September 1st.
@delphinium83 1/20th the pay of a typical CEO, nice.  Planned Parenthood still a non-profit.  Appendectomies kill appendixes.
.@RubenKihuen also didn't budge on backing Planned Parenthood, came out for boots on the ground to defeat ISIS. Back to 5:30 everywhere Fri.
Planned Parenthood getting exposed for the evil organization they are. http://t.co/CMHsYd4m0X @laurawrpie @myGianLuca

Every Sat I pass people protesting Planned Parenthood on my way to work, &amp; it makes me determined to donate more to them every fucking time!
If you're dumb enough to believe the Planned Parenthood sting videos, you are complicit in burning an office http://t.co/ifN31B9l3k
Democrats will say #BlackLivesMatter as they march you right up to the doorstep of Planned Parenthood. http://t.co/NrOXWR9bL9

Pope's faster annulment plan may not mean as much in the US. http://t.co/JQT2PL2GNg @Pontifex
We just had a great time with Joyce Coronel with The Catholic Sun.  She interviewed several families who are going to see the Pope.
Pope says marriage annulment should be free, new rules may mean marriages can be annulled in just 45 days in some cases.
@bertyashley @RichardDawkins Better call the Pope. He may be more sympathetic, one never knows.

Who so ever hate you doesn't matter.I know that you will be the 16th time champ. And hope you will break Ric Flair's record.NeverGiveUp
I hope Ric Flair prevents John Cena from getting his 16th title. Wwe write that into the script @TripleH @StephMcMahon
Quick reminder to folks agreeing with Jon. Ric Flair's 16th reign came via Kevin Nash handing him the title. He lost it about an hour later.
Odd because Cena and Nikki were seen laughing with Ric Flair Saturday or Sunday. https://t.co/b8NpoeiHMr
I hope that when @RonFunches wins @midnight for the 16th time, Ric Flair comes out to congratulate him. Unless Jon Stewart interferes.
I just took a Coach Freeze clip out of the new @HeadtoHeadRadio intro, to make room for Ric Flair. I love my job. New intro debuts tomorrow!
lol Keller insinuating Ric Flair may have fed Meltzer the Cena is holding Charlotte down story.
@LaurenceWHolmes What do you mean, Laurence? The Dudleys, Ric Flair, and Sting were on Raw Monday. Taker wrestled Sunday. It IS the 90s.

Made my morning coffee and sat down to watch the news...Sarah Palin is on.   What a horrible way to start the day.
Pls CNN why in a world u bring this idiot Sarah Palin on Sunday great news program state of the Union CNN u really fuck up my Sunday
@CNNSotu @SarahPalinUSA  Sarah Palin may be a stupid cow  -- but she is our stupid cow. We love her
What a wonderful Sunday. We've already received great insight from the best of the Republican Party (Colin Powell) and worst (Sarah Palin)
9am sun: I hope my neighbors just heard me ask my phone to google "Sarah Palin's makeup routine" and then sneeze like a lumberjack 3x
I think Sarah Palin may have a health issue . I had a hyper - active thyroid and I still can't remember all of the odd things I said &amp; did.
I miss when Sarah Palin was a bigger deal, she was so easy to make fun of. Saturday night live got so fucking lucky with her.
She may have said "speak American" but Sarah Palin is right. Any immigrant to a foreign country needs to learn to speak the language there
Some low hanging Monday fruit:  "Sarah Palin says immigrants to the US should 'speak American'" http://t.co/aaKybqiLbK
Sarah Palin says US immigrants should speak "american", does she mean Navajo or Sioux? http://t.co/SLfVeoMb6C
@guardian "Speak American" that may just sum up how stupid Sarah Palin is. I thought they spoke English in the US or a bastersised version.
In boxing a 1-2 punch means a potential knock out If George W Bush was the 1st Punch in America's face, we were lucky to escape Sarah Palin

@Petapup1 @S3nt13ntB31ng @SaculSacul won't  be the 1st time SCOTUS violated the Constitution &amp; won't be the last.
@FoxNewsLive  The Law of the land is religious freedom 1st Amendment protects RF not FRF. SCOTUS was wrong. Kate Smith is right
@magicalvidyacat Seems fitting that there's a parallel there, and that SCOTUS used 14th Amendment to override the 10th. @Rinaxas
You say it's not a right. SCOTUS says it is. Constitution says we follow SCOTUS. Fucking done! https://t.co/iyANr58fvq
@LizSchmidt3 SCOTUS determined that to be the 14th amendment's due process clause and equal protection clauses. #Oberfeige #readityourself

And @whytology article 3 gives SCOTUS no legislative powers and the 10th amendment is clear. The 14th sec 5 requires an act of congress.
@rbassilian @souperfan2013  Actually there were many laws passed by many people in the states, SCOTUS just ignored the 10th Amendment
@jspoupart @JoeC1776 no. Congress makes laws and the SCOTUS settles disputes. In this case, the 1st Amendment lost.

@politibunny @brakinggnus @dangoddu @jbryant710 SCOTUS violated the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution not allowing #KimDavis #1A right
@israel4911 @Letha_Hughes It was the 14th that SCOTUS ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality. News not your strong subject.
@domnogin @AdamBaldwin @algore @MiamiHerald Gore lost the election 3 weeks before the SCOTUS took Bush v Gore. 10th Amendment argument fails
@LeeAdams_4Him purpose of the SCOTUS is to establish constitutionality of laws. they ruled that gay marriage bans violated 14th amend rights

@Billd111 @megynkelly @tedcruz SCOTUS has determined that the 14th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens
@cspanwj In their recent pro gay marriage decision, SCOTUS has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the United States Constitution.
@alphainparis 14th Amendment is the one used by SCOTUS in the marriage equality ruling. @gshevlin
@RushedLimbo you're literally incapable of intimidating me. anyways SCOTUS interprets the constitution. mar equality is the law of the land
@thebobbynelson if the SCOTUS decided that the 14th A gave a Muslim woman the right to no longer wear a head scarf, or that marriage
@AlphaKruse @suz123nj @papalputz @OtterDose @MatStaver SCOTUS vitiated KY marriage law immediately b/c it violated 14th Amendment
@count_01 SCOTUS based their argument on the 14th. No matter how you stretch it race was not involved.
@LarryOConnor @GretchenCarlson U sound like the hated "smartset" now? Is #KimDavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from SCOTUS in history?

My sick day has consisted of watching Seinfeld and Facetiming and it may be the best day I've had all summer.
Nothing like a rainy Sunday with coffee, Seinfeld reruns and the right amount of laziness.

@Morning_Joe I haven't laughed this hard on a Thur night since Seinfeld ended. Not the last episode though, that one was terrible.
Nothing like watching episodes of Seinfeld on a Sunday morning.Seen all but the humorous slant is different each time. Magic @JerrySeinfeld
@solemnoathbeer @TheBruery To paraphrase Seinfeld: are you going to double dip?  This pic (of wax cover) looks much different than 1st pic.
I told someone about how I once sat on the floor of my hotel room and watched Seinfeld for hours and they threatened to punch me.
@jellybean1398 watching the last episode 1st is why I skipped watching Seinfeld for MANY yrs. The 1st few yrs at least of Mad Men were good.
Will watch old movies, Seinfeld and other silly things till Sunday...the old #katrina news footage is too much for this heart to bear.
I just bought tickets to see Seinfeld in Durham next month. What a great Tuesday!

@Crimson_Smiles I was going to til  I saw "hate Seinfeld" .... Yea about that shirt..go ahead and wear Crimson to Knox Friday night
@sethhinz haha! Seriously, though, it reminds me of the Seinfeld character Jimmy. "Jimmy liked worship this Sunday."  #chsocm
I'm pretty sure Serena ripped that match winning ace the same time USMNT game up their 3rd.

Serena defeat Venus again only this time Venus put up a fight and made to a 3rd set unlike last time i saw it #usopen
Dem born Venus come born Serena on top. Blessings on Blessings on Blessings.... May our children always excel and make us proud #USOpen
I hope every young girl watched the Williams sisters tonight. Serena may have won but they'll go down as the greatest sibling duo ever!
Serena is emotionally drained. Hope she has time to rest up before Thursday.
Serena be lettin oponents comeback in the 2nd set just to make the media feel better. That good #SerenaVsVenus
Serena may have taken that match, but Venus wins.  So much class.  Just a good person. The same cannot be said about her sister.  #veealways
You may think Venus and Serena are impressive, but are you aware of that one time my sister and I fought over a ham sandwich?
Serena won. The Cubs are winning in St. Louis. I'm enjoying sports lately. Too bad the Bears play this Sunday.
Serena dominated in the end, a tough match for the win! https://t.co/QHjXSFz4Bi
Know what's scary? Serena was mildly injured a little after Wimbledon and sat out before the US Open.  She could win with that formula.
Now that I've calmed down after watching Serena.... Do you realize how great tomorrow's Vika-Simona match is gonna be??
It was so good venus killed serena the 2nd set but serena won the game with an ace  https://t.co/qZJMW0y7gP
Couldn't hang on to stay up and watch 3rd set but it was nice to see Serena beat Venus. What a resilient, tough player Venus is, tho.
Going to the U.S. Open on Thursday so I hope Serena wins tonight
I really hope that Obama attends Serena's match on Saturday...Ciara's doing the National Anthem. Give us deze ratings biches.

Everyone should most definitely not go watch Star Wars on December 18th because it'll be a terrible movie
@tokyofox not about that but there'll be many more things you'll get excited about Star Wars coming out in Japan before Dec 18.
I haven't told anyone but I bought about $30 in Star Wars merch on force Friday and I'm proud of it
Chris just said he likes Star Wars more than me. If I wasn't so relaxed that may have been a big argument haha
It's official, Star Wars to be released in the UK on the 17th of December. http://t.co/bFST0e1vBs
December 18th is my last day of undergrad, and the day that Sisters and Star Wars is released. It will be a great day.

Star Wars released a day earlier in the UK,Thursday Dec 17th... Tomorrow,days will be booked off work for this day long remembered.
@OsoFreshFutbol I think the expectations are so low in Avatar land it may be a sleeper. Star Wars land is going to be tough to do right.
#ForceFriday as a whole was pretty disappointing. Not sure who dropped the ball - retailers, Hasbro, or Disney. It's Star Wars! C'mon!
@ImBoardWithLife @ChrisBryanGames what Star Wars game released on Force Friday are you most interested in?
@alexkidwell I give zero shits about Star Wars, and I'm only mildly excited by Bond films. Will I be seeing you on RHAP tomorrow?!
there's not really anyone I know irl that gets passionate enough about Star Wars I need to find new friends before dec 18th
Just discovered the complete first season of Star Wars rebels is available for free On Demand. Tomorrow's work day just got AWESOME.
@TOPPSMIKE I also cross trade for huddle and bunt. I may quit Star Wars and want to cross trade. Don't want to be suspended again. Thoughts?
@rebelrealcanon Nothing wrong with that. I was in 4th grade when Episode I was released. I'd seen the OT before, but TPM is my Star Wars!
Sting defeat the @GoderichGrizz 9-4 ... On to fullarton tomorrow night to face the @FullartonAs
PWInsider reports that several sources indicate Sting flew back to New York City tonight, which could mean he appears at RAW tomorrow night.
great RAW tonight...1st the Dudley Boys and then to end with Sting!!!   #WWERaw #WWE
Sting winning at #NightOfChampions results in either Sting vs Taker at Mania or Sting vs Cena and I've got a bad feeling it's the 2nd option
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/zDth0kovNW Seth Rollins vs Sting the Returns 2015 WWE Raw, Aug 24
C'mon, Vince...we're not stupid.  We all know Sting's going to job to Rollins to make him look strong.
Loving the Sting stuff &amp; especially loving the way Triple sold it all... STING WAS IN THE BOX! http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW
The Sting stuff just being great &amp; loving how Triple H sold the "big reveal"... http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW
I hope Sting spends his time at #RAW tomorrow complaining about how long he had to stand behind that curtain while @WWERollins went on &amp; on
@KevinLive5 thanks! I know you would have the answer. Hope all is well! I'm sure Sting last Monday had you jacked up with energy!
HERE WE GO Monday Night Raw hopefully we get another good show tonight Sting vs Rollins at NOC should be really good #RAW
What a good way to open Monday Night Raw with Sting, lovin it! #RAW #WWE
#StingonRaw what a great way to start off Monday night Raw with Sting!
Instead of that, Sting has to suck up to Hunter. I realize it may be planting a seed for HHH/Rollins, but I hate dumb faces.
He may be 56, but Sting is still as passionate as ever and still has the fire. Still awesome on the mic. He and Rollins will be M-O-N-E-Y.
Not that I don't love Seth Rollins, he's gold on the belts. But this may be Sting's only title run sooo #StingOnRaw #RAW #RawTampa

Tiger Woods was 2 behind leader, Jason Gore, after the 3rd rnd but is in a strong position http://t.co/43ouISCIbP http://t.co/SZJlFjfS1a
Is Tiger Woods form finally returning or is it a one off. Unlucky lip out on 18th but an aggressive putt.
Not sure I wanted Tiger Woods to win a golf tournament more than I do today. Swallowed the pride, showed up and delivered. C'mon big cat!

may i just say that Tom Cruise looks hot as fuck in a navy blue suit
Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise is another bad ass movie; I have never seen it till now.
I'm not huge fan of Tom Cruise but much like the last movie I saw him in, Edge of Tomorrow, #MissionImpossibleRogueNation was really good.
@nuahs6881 You mean Edge of Tomorrow? It is surprisingly wonderful and I wound up feeling about Tom Cruise the way I did as a kid after
good things i saw on the way to work: - car w picture of tom cruise in the 1st mission: impossible movie - "TUSHI DR" license plate

Speaking of Tom Cruise, by the 5th instalment you'd think it'd be undeniably clear that those Missions are actually quite Possible...
Just watched "Edge of Tomorrow" and liked it. Mostly because Tom Cruise died a hundred times.
@Aellis994 edge of tomorrow is a well good film! Didn't know he directed that aswell. Im just gonna ignore the critisisms of Tom Cruise
The "Edge of Tomorrow" ad campaign really should've been more focused on the promise of getting to watch Tom Cruise die over and over again.

So Cameron has lost Telegraph and The Sun over #refugeecrisis. So who supports him? Do Tory right really want drowned children on beaches?

@IrateGreek Correct! When 3rd memo voted and starts bighting in Tsipras likely to go the way of Pasok &amp; ND. Euro? 63% say don't fear drachma
The way the encounter with Tsipras is described suggests someone who likes to tell a good tale, no matter the cost http://t.co/GCo9QuVp38
What makes the 3rd bailout different is that, after Tsipras, there will be no one left inside Greece to credibly manage the memorandum
Tsipras: (on referendum) I Thought No was going to win, on Thursday. On Friday I was certain of it
Tsipras says snap election may be needed if he lacks a parliamentary majority http://t.co/R1fjEHwFrK #Forex http://t.co/04eMTitzeb
Love or hate Tsipras, he's told nothing but the truth since day 1. Wouldn't see honesty like that with other leaders https://t.co/tcHI7WgwAo
Tsipras: Varoufakis may have bad dress sense, but he's no crook -PHOTO http://t.co/wLY6dQ4ltM via @enikos_en
@ronanburtenshaw restructured, so long as a good show of 'toeing the line' is made 1st, then Tsipras is a quisling. @Marouskavia @atsipras
@Montse70v  On Mar 23 I enthusiastically wrote the above about Tsipras. Now, unfortunately, I'm terribly disappointed about his leadership.
Greek parliament has just approved 3rd bailout 222:64 votes. Yet Tsipras seeks vote of confidence on August 20th. Future is still uncertain.
Tsipras confident Athens will be able to finalize 3rd bailout deal with creditors http://t.co/CM5JCvu6Fu
Dont  underestimate the power of the pple, don't be sure Tsipras will win, many who voted Syriza the 1st won't now https://t.co/sfaYGW1k4n
Having marched people to the top of the hill more than once, Tsipras may find the Greek people have tired of his grand old Duke of York act.
Tsipras resigned on Thursday night after he lost the support from within his Syriza party. That is classic #Grexit.
@ekathimerini Far Left has used and uses Tsipras as a wheelbarrow to the microphones, as #Tsipras used #ND and #PASOK before January 25.
The dark end of the love story "When Tsipras met Varoufakis" http://t.co/IBderNcd5M
@Reuters The snap election will be on 20 September while the opposition groups such as Lafazanis led Popular unity or ND accused Tsipras
Tsipras says that the September 20 elections will provide his party a strong mandate to form a majority government. http://t.co/pWzd4KhDmj
Tsipras said it as if it was a bad thing. ... it is good.  Austerity, not "austerity" should come naturally. https://t.co/lVEEeQ4Hlh
Tsipras asks for strong mandate so that the Left may continue to govern http://t.co/B5UK7qtSfN
I guess the great British public who voted Labour instead of UKIP in May can thank their lucky stars that we don't have a Lab/SNP Gov now...

@francesbarber13 Did you read this Frances? Country would be a mess if the UKIP crowd had their way.NHS for sure. http://t.co/I7li4oFHjJ
@JasonSmithUKIP Hi Jason, are you free for a quick phone interview tomorrow for podcast on what Ukip's priorities are for next parliament?

Bloody love Europe, UKIP can fuck right off! Sipping a Grimbergen Ambre in the Lyon sun whilst getting my beige on &gt; racist ignorant pricks.
I've a relative who is "traditional labour", moved to UKIP in May  She's not impressed by Corbyn. Mythical that he can win these people back
Leftist hypocrisy of the day: "The Mail's 'Corbyn's 1st 1000 days' is a viscous smear. Channel 4's 'UKIP's 1st 100 days' was good, though"
@Bunsolomopo Awesome, good selection there. Yeah i was up 13-18th. Saw Phil Wang, UKIP the Musical and some free stuff as well as Limbo
@martyj21 https://t.co/ulJsErILMH Idiots attracted to all parties. Difference with UKIP is media prepared to dig through years of profiles;
There's a simple solution, just deport all the far right wing Tory &amp; UKIP voting cocksuckers ! https://t.co/kfAn0Z7S15
@LordAshcroft went to UKIP and ppl wont be fooled twice with weasel words I wont vt 4 them again it will b 1st time in 70yrs DC deceitful.
@LBC inside he probably thinks he has been duped by UKIP &amp; media instead of believing 1st experience of a dying, hard working Brit.
@JadeFrancesAzim Very strong hold - especially given UKIP's showing in the Barnsley seats in May.
@SLATUKIP  We're on fire at the moment: we've a Tory government by UKIP design implementing our great #ukipmanifesto &amp; the 1st #Brexit vote
and the 40 seats Labour lost in Scotland?...not to UKIP... https://t.co/mB0MgkM2sN
@gazborangers @HumzaYousaf May well but is it coincidence that UKIP and England more on the right where &amp; popular &amp; less up here?
BBC News - Theresa May: Free EU movement 'for those with jobs' http://t.co/KyoqhvwpL9 quite right Theresa, come and join UKIP
so theresa may has today publicly said the same thing as what nigel farage and UKIP get attacked for saying ??
Cameron's gone full UKIP, then. Will head off Corbyn threat by going far right. http://t.co/OjSUgMWZOL
@h8kes @MikkiL @RoisinDoherty_ @Independent I hope the UKIP comes to power and saves UK. The British tell You god bless you. We tell may
@Rockerq They will not be safe. We will march on Clapton with lead piping and beat UKIP into the sea.
@Nigel_Farage, thanks to @petersththanet whatever credibility UKIP may have had has just been lost forever. http://t.co/Aa0eoRW0UM
Yes, but UKIP said the Dad only did it for new teeth. Or some other sick nonsense.  https://t.co/s599qsRkcU
@BaronGraham I understand why people may support them, but I totally despise UKIP. They're racist bigoted beasts, nothing average about that
@JamieRoss7 @mrjamesob I don't think she understood UKIP  at all. Suggest Nuttily Bennett may be more in step with her views
If there were an election tomorrow,UKIP still wouldnt get a great number of MP's,I hate to say it but I think this country is about finished
Never forget. UKIP share a platform in the EU Parliament with these. Hope UKIP voters are suitably ashamed. http://t.co/99khTJeJsl
@nathggns Labour amendment, likely supported by the SNP, green and UKIP. Some eurosceptic tories may support it - it'll be close
@Tim_Aker I think an emergency council meeting is needed. We trusted UKIP at the last election and there's an important by election Thursday
"@DavidJo52951945: I hope UKIP's Thanet Council refuse to take any refugees or immigrants &amp; say they are putting the needs of Brits 1st"
Deplorable and wrong-headed comments by Bristol's only UKIP councillor. I hope he loses his seat in May and UKIP fold http://t.co/l4k1GggRlm
@freedmanhp4 @JohnRentoul @lordbonkers May be good news for UKIP too though Corbyn is the most Eurosceptic leader since Michael Foot.

Tom Izzo says on @DrivewithJack from Italy that Valentine was out of legs in 4th qtr yesterday, didn't want him hurt so decided to sit him.
I hope that guy goes all out for Valentine's Day. The fkn works. Then a few days before feb 14 he checks her phone, and sees a few messages
November babies are products of Valentine's day. Thats prob why scorpios are so sexual and affectionate
I think I posted surprise incest in the Golden Sun fanfic category once on Valentine's Day. I was a terrible person.
If you love someone, don't shoot them with an arrow. Contrary to Valentine's Day, it does not mean they'll stay. It may mortally wound them.
This next Valentine's Day may just one of many, but it doesn't have to be that way. Bid on one of these beautiful clocks this season.

Today was the first time Ive gotten stood up since my 2nd grade Valentine's Day class party. Because my valentine was "too sick for school"
Football season ends the Sunday before Valentine's Day. Which will be good for all of the not dates I'll have lined up.
in 6th grade there was this boy that liked me, but I hated him, and for Valentine's Day he put a card in my locker w. $5 in it... goals.
In 8th grade, I wrote my boyfriend a love poetry book w 15 original haikus &amp; gave him it for Valentine's Day. I deeply regret this decision.

@ToddKlindt Pieces of it existed for Pro and Enterprise when Windows 10 launched on July 29. Its just that it wasn't made clear until now.

@EGN_Dragoneez that game was a lot of fun. They should've been came out with a 2nd one. I'm glad it's coming to the Xbox one.
Castle crashers free for Xbox one. Tomorrow!! Only  for those who owns the game on Xbox  360.  I'm ready for this! http://t.co/CvcNflakM2
@BenAves @lukepatterson90 Ryan kindly gave me a month free trial code. Gonna renew it when my Xbox lives needs renewing... On the 12th
@thepieface I hate it more. My Xbox controller is in London so I can't play until sunday
Castle crashers remastered on xbox one is free if you have the original on xbox 360 till 20th Sept. Releases today. #castleCrashers #XboxOne
I'm proud of what my Xbox live Gamertag is going to be tomorrow. Me and my friends just thought of it.
Friday is about to be such a great day frist day on my new Xbox one
Need a person with a 2box / 2nd Xbox. Will get free EB
@SoaRRolex make sure u get your 2nd Xbox and get  BIGG TERRY on there to setup for us
@SegmentNext I got an xbox one on the 7th of April this year and it looks good for zombie games
@tamaki_ebooks well I'm getting an Xbox one on the 18th so don't worry, I'll be able to talk about it soon. I just don't know if I wanna-
Having Xbox downloadable games always release on Wed. was such a smart move. Now, it's chaos. No idea what's out or when.

Can't wait to see the @ChelseaFC blues and that dude Zlatan on Saturday. I mean @TooIaZy
@hello_noto01 Zlatan!  Cavani has been unhappy about playing 2nd fiddle to Ibrahimovic... He's signing a new contract! Zlatan to MUFC?
LOL Aulas still mad about the penalty Zlatan took a 2nd time a few month ago. I'm delighted by the fact that he is still butt-hurt about it!
We are certainly gonna see Verratti in the 2nd half. I'm like a kid waiting for his present ;-) Oh &amp; Zlatan starts so thats great. #PSGFIO
Zlatan is still a beast. If he's replacing RvP then it's good business  https://t.co/M2IZ9Vv5KG
Would love to see Zlatan in the Premier League. He may be an egotistical fruit loop but it would be fun #Zlatan
If Alexandre Lacazette does move to PSG does that mean that a Zlatan transfer may be in the making? #Ibrahimovic #soccer #futbol
@Jon_LeGossip Thoughts about the aubameyang rumors? Cover if Zlatan leaves? Or adding depth? Augustin a good 3rd Striker for UCL quality?
@DanSanders123 @MoneyMitch624 @BleacherReport @espn HA I just saw this.. Made my Sunday.. Also Zlatan is really good at soccer Norris
So, about Zlatan... I don't want him. All reports are that he's not a good teammate. He'd be our 3rd DP Fwd, how do you work the 3 together?
Our squad right now is good enough to challenge for the 3rd place, but if we sign Romagnoli, Witsel and Zlatan, i see us title condenders
fucking cunt. I hope he eats Zlatan's shit in retirement league. https://t.co/blH85NzExz
Apparently Zlatan may leave PSG for United. He's already at a team that buys every high rate payer and wins fuck all, not sure why he'd go.
Sun are so full of shit they say PSG trying to replace Zlatan with Neymar hahaha
I would love to have cavani man. He's over shawdowed and played 2nd fiddle to Zlatan he would shine at arsenal
@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price
@dani_pitter I mean I get the hype around JLaw. I may not like her but I get her hype. I just don't understand Amy Schumer and her hype
I just think that sports are stupid &amp;anyone who likes them is a lesser person &amp; has a small intellect- Amy Schumer https://t.co/fdjWKKG5AR
"If you do like Amy Schumer, I hope you went &amp; saw her Saturday bc after this ridiculousness, I highly doubt Maine will be on list of faves."

Inside Amy Schumer is scorching its merry way back onto @ComedyCentralUK in the new year. S3 begins on Jan 11 at 11pm. (S2 still on demand.)
Kind of equally excited at staying in watching The Soup finale tonight as I am for going out to see Amy Schumer tomorrow. Well...kind of
"One of the 1st jokes from the hilarious Amy Schumer at @TWCArena: ""If anybody thought they were seeing 'Godspell' tonight, maybe exit left."""
Some may find it tragic that I'm sat alone watching Amy Schumer and eating Ben and Jerries but personally I feel no shame
"Watching 'Inside Amy Schumer' for the 1st time. She's funny, sassy, smart, beautiful...&amp; sleeps with a teddy bear in one sketch. I'm hooked."
"When it comes to body empowerment and feeling comfortable in your own skin, Amy Schumer is the role model we look up to. On Thursday"

"If you're having doubts about Ant-Man, just go and see it, you won't be disappointed. He may not be a major character, but the movie is good"
In other news I saw Ant-Man! It may have a few flaws but I absolutely loved it! So funny and the character is brilliant
It's the first of August and started off good with Ant-Man.
Just saw Ant-Man in the theatre for the 3rd time.  It's still super great.

Michael Douglas may not be coming back for another Marvel film...he did so good in Ant-Man though

My dad and sister will try out Daredevil series tomorrow. They really liked Ant-Man when I recommended it to them...  HEHEHEHEHE!
Planning to watch Ant-Man tomorrow and see all the fuss about .... I hope I won't get disappointed .....
Question... is Ant-Man any good? tempted to go watch it tomorrow
"Seeing Ant-Man on monday, finally. 9pm showing, so i'll be useless the next day. And I don't care."
"Seeing Ant-Man tomorrow, flat, it just isn't worth $40 *more* to see it in 3D. We'll just have to use our imaginations."
Shoutout to @bthousto for going with me to see Ant-Man (highly recommend) and scoring us free ice cream yesterday. Best 2nd to last day here
Somehow I was able to enjoy the 2nd half of Ant-Man in spite of my gleeful anticipation about all the Ant-Lamb jokes I couldn't wait to make
"Sure, ANT-MAN is a cool film, but make sure you know all your movie options. ... (Vine by SATURDAY NIGHT VINE) https://t.co/DyXAETE6Vt"

@Amirosie I finally saw Ant-Man on Tuesday it was so good &amp; entertaining also I enjoyed the Spider-Man reference

"Back to work tomorrow so off to the cinema to finally watch Ant-Man with Jackson. Heard good things, plus it's Marvel... It's gonna be mega!"
"Get paid on Friday and all I can think about wanting to do is go to the cinema to watch Ant-Man, too many good looking films coming out"

@castlescrumbln A response to Bad Blood may make the album ugly.
Discussing the T Swift vs K Perry feud with boyf (he was unaware). He's a big fan of both. He says he's torn. May have to boycott Bad Blood.
Listening to Bad Blood on the radio 1st time: this is awful 8: people like this? 15: that bass line isn't so bad  Now: NOW WE GOT BAD BLOOD
Bad Blood is such a terrible fucking song. I just listened to it for the 1st time and I feel like God took a shit in my ears
16th hats in the last verse of Bad Blood are soooo sick
@GraceRosee22 3rd: Bad Blood won video of the year and she took all the women in the video up w her and said stupid shit
"@RachEmma_ @Katysbiatch glad you both enjoyed that haha! I'm still recovering from her tweet about Bad Blood, that was a 3rd degree burn"
"@SwiftUpdatesSp @tswiftweb13 I hope the 2nd. ""Bad Blood"" have already peaked and the hype is kinda over."
Bad Blood is nominated for practically every VMA under the sun and I'm surprised it's not in the 'video with a social message' category
Bad Blood sounds like it was written by a 7th grader who's mad at her best friend..... Yet here I am singing to it in my car

Bad Blood by Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift may be my guilty pleasure of the year. I wish more mainstream pop was like this.
"Honestly, I'm liking Kendrick's ""Bad Blood"" verses a lot more now. May be able to elevate the song to being really good to me."
"I love ""Bad Blood"" and I love the music video, but it is just Taylor acting a damn fool. Like c'mon."
"Jess Glynne has a song called ""Bad Blood"" on her new album &amp; I'm seeing her in November &amp; I hope she does a BB/BB Remix."

Short drive to work this morning with Bad Blood--Raspberry Beret--Out of Style as my soundtrack.  Tuesday gonna be a good day.

This is upsetting! you may not like Briana but  spreading these false rumors that could ruin her life is horrible  https://t.co/41Ufbrn4ON
briana may be pregnant but louis isnt the dad or atleast he is not excited about it you can obviously see it when he's been asked about it
im so happy that danielle may be with louis bc then briana and her stupid family can stop acting like they entitlement and just hav the
ok but louis hasnt been seen with briana since like what march ???? he is never with her and he looks so uncomfortable when interviewers+
yea im done with briana she getting blocked for the 3rd time now
yeah. its just that the other day my feed was plastered with hate to briana and I did https://t.co/3ooI6kc0IC https://t.co/zmI35y38OM

I think having Briana be a full-time housewife may be the best thing for the show as she would be a good way for the girls to let Vicki back
Just because the sex tape may be of Briana doesn't mean Louis isn't the dad like come on....
Louis' having a baby with Briana but then he's currently with Danielle. I mean c'mon... He could have focus more with the baby by now.

"#JohnKerry says #ISIS had a ""rationale"" for the Charlie Hebdo killings in January (pic of Muhammad), but Friday night in Paris was different"

Donald Trump's response to the Charlie Hebdo shooting that took place in January just shows how ignorant and stupid he really is
"Guys, that Sky Vine flying around Twitter of the Eiffel Tower going dark is from JANUARY after Charlie Hebdo. Different horrendous tragedy."
Make sure to check your sources if you're getting info from social media. Accidental references to Charlie Hebdo.  https://t.co/iZbffHkxBU
The fact he sees the rationale of Charlie Hebdo attack is why his policies are impotent against ISIS https://t.co/lioj3kMJgH
hope this isnt another False Flag by MOSSAD in Paris like Charlie Hebdo bullshit. France is playing ball with Israel so it may not be them

"@JoeNYLaw @nypost At the @BlueJacketsNHL game on Sat. someone yelled ""Charlie Hebdo."" Not sure they meant it in a nice way..."
@Lucidmanx @johnson If the comment was in reference to the 'Charlie Hebdo' violent attack in january: it is no less repugnant. In my opinion
@MxJackMonroe @realDonaldTrump Tweeted January at time of Charlie Hebdo - stupid then (&amp; now) but not tweeted tonight.
"@SamaelGore that's alright. Keep fighting the good fight &amp; as with Charlie Hebdo, long may the real France endure. A great people."
"@boyOfagirl I think it may be ideology, religion free and open speech (Charlie Hebdo) and yes bombing in Syria!!!"
@ggiittiikkaa I wish and hope @tehseenp had same courage of convictions in writing to ISIS to march with Charlie Hebdo cartoons on T-shirt
@iFighterPilot @soldier_pk may be that's the reason Charlie Hebdo was attacked in first place
@naazrashid It may not be the best idea but *some* action is needed. School kids should not be calling for Charlie Hebdo to die @sofiaahmed1
"After Charlie Hebdo murders, some people blamed the journalists. Hope they're ashamed: France now 2nd most dangerous country for reporters."
"Also, the 'not afraid' pictures are from after the Charlie Hebdo attack from January, not after the Parisian attacks."

"I may regret this later in the season, but I'm so happy for David Wright."
In his first AB since 4/14 David Wright sent a pitch into the 2nd row of the 2nd deck in left. Would love him if he wasn't a Met.
It's good to see my man David Wright back in the lineup... Time to be a captain and lead us deep into October #mets #LGM
Mets 3B David Wright crushed the ball deep to left on the third pitch of his 1st at-bat
"Monday was a great sign for David Wright. But if he stumbles, he's willing to take a backseat: http://t.co/Z7okgykZ2O http://t.co/VOqkrYDs7G"
My daughter begged me to take her to David Wright's 1st game back in Philly. Guess I look like quite the bad Dad now. Mets have 7 HR inc DW
So happy David Wright is coming back tomorrow!!! Hopefully he an stay off the DL. Another big bat in the lineup!!! #WrightTime #LGM
Threw out 1st pitch tonight and David Wright was so nice to sign it #StLucieMets #TraditionField http://t.co/09YJrEFna5

I hate myself for doing this. Happy last day at Dunkin tomorrow. May I never have to make a rude bitches coffee again http://t.co/fxfDzctIn5
"Tried Dunkin's Oreo iced coffee &amp; it's not as good as it *could* be. Then again, I may have too high of hopes for cookie-flavored coffee."
What's the requirement to work at Dunkin? Complete up to 8th grade? Reasons I hate going there. No people skills.
sad that my dunkin won't have pumpkin coffee till the 29th
So I was at Dunkin and this idiot messed up my order 4 times then he said he wasn't giving me my order the 5th like what the hell he stupid.

"@AlexRea98 tomorrow morning before work I'm getting pumpkin coffee from Dunkin, if there isn't any, you're responsible"

@teamgabrod I like pumpkin muffins from Dunkin!  Would Thursday or Friday be good for you??
A little old man at Dunkin donuts told me I was beautiful. With the Monday I've had...i needed that.

"I know it's just preseason but do I still get free Dunkin tomorrow, or nahhhh?"
I try to always pay for the order behind me at Dunkin on Monday's..starts both of our weeks off on a good note.
If anyone is stopping at Dunkin and would be so kind to get me a coffee I'll pay you back tomorrow so hit me up! Thanks!!!
If someone wants to bring me Dunkin tomorrow that would make me happy
"Just got a large iced coffee from Dunkin, which is my 6th cup of coffee (so far) today. Do you think that's bad?"
May or may not be addicted to the cold apple cider from Dunkin
My 9-5 job is ACTUALLY 9-5 now! I will celebrate with Dunkin' Donuts tomorrow.. You're welcome for the free advertising btw @Reno_Dunkin
So glad tomorrow's my last day at Dunkin
"The fact that Bailey is bringing Dunkin into work tomorrow, is the only thing keeping me motivated to wake up in the morning."
The only good thing about today was the guy at dunkin telling me this morning that they'd have pumpkin coffee tomorrow...
This morning there was no traffic and the person in front of me at dunkin paid for my drink :) happy friday!!
When Dunkin' Donuts actually get your order right on a Saturday morning you know it's going to be a good day
When you're really excited that the boss is buying you Dunkin after a long Friday .... @AlexxPariseau http://t.co/TQVTYs2AM9
"You know it's been a great weekend when you spend  $50 in dunkin donuts on fri, sat, and sunday."

if anyone wants to surprise me with a mocha iced coffee from Dunkin tomorrow that'd be cool

"With the sun on your face, Dunkin, Anna Karenina &amp; the music of @StevieNicks how could anyone be in a bad mood? #relaxation #selfcare"
"Dustin Johnson having a complete meltdown on the 1st hole, on the green in 6 or 7 I've lost count. #PGAChampionship"
Dustin Johnson just took an 8 on the 1st hole. I don't feel so bad about my golf game suddenly. #PGAChampionship #snowman
Just pulled a Dustin Johnson on the 18th at Castle Creek and don't know if I've ever been this depressed
"R&amp;A's handling of the end of round 2 was diabolical. I watched Spieth, Matsuyama and Dustin Johnson early Saturday, very unfair on them."
"@MikeAndMike 1500 to 1?  That may explain Dustin Johnson's 75, if you know what I mean,"
"As sure as the sun coming up everyday, Dustin Johnson implodes at a Sunday major #PGAChampionship"
"David Duval, who needed to birdie the 18th last night just to get qualify for the weekend, is now only two shots behind Dustin Johnson."
Dustin Johnson goes -6 and in the lead - did anyone take Bryan's advice and take the 25s on 1st round leader for the #pga? getting excited?
Dustin Johnson is fast becoming the Greg Norman of bad luck in golf majors. I hope DJ's misfortune turns into something positive on Monday.
Dustin Johnson is playing like me on the 1st hole. That is not a good thing. #PGAChampionship
"Dustin Johnson looks like he really wants to be on the Not Top 10 tomorrow. Any press is good press, good looks"
"Dustin Johnson on round of 75: ""I hit plenty of good shots, just couldn't roll it in."" Says he needs something in 62-63-64 range tomorrow."
Dustin Johnson's scorecard is ridiculous. Starts with a snowman on the 1st hole. Since then hes added 2 eagles and 4 birdies
I thought Dustin Johnson chokes on 18 in Majors? Does this mean he will win tomorrow?
Not often when you see Dustin Johnson going low on a Sunday
Really hope Dustin Johnson shoots something in the low 60's tomorrow and is at least in contention. So many haters out there.
Some day at #TheOpen2015 . Incredible stuff from Paul Dunne and Padraig Harrington. Baffling round by Dustin Johnson. Monday will be great.
Sunday seems to be a bad day for Dustin Johnson to play in majors!! Maybe Mondays will be better.
@Brucehillbhoy up there with him and dustin Johnson and I love to see there pain on a Sunday
"@JamesFenn90 Like you say, Rory, Spieth, Rose and Day should be great to watch. If Dustin Johnson can get his head together he may join them"
@Tyler_Tremelle was angry at me after Friday because Dustin Johnson was outperforming Jordan Spieth. He's now quite happy with me.
@_andrewclarke: Dustin Johnson good 1st day again. Deja vu on him flopping next few days.
Dustin Johnson has a great chance to win the @PGAChampionship as long as there is no Sunday round. @DJohnsonPGA
Dustin Johnson is leading the PGA but don't worry. Saturday is only 2 days away
"Dustin Johnson makes an eagle on 16 to move to -13. He may not have a major, but boy is he wonderful to watch when on song. #USPGA"
"Dustin Johnson may wind up being another in the long list of athletes with ""million dollar arm and five cent head"" ... hope not"
"Dustin Johnson rolls to a Thursday clubhouse lead in a major, of course: Perhaps it's a good thing Dustin John... http://t.co/5wBjjjeb6f"
"Dustin Johnson sure knows how to get an early lead on Thursday, he just can't hang on to that lead on Sunday"
"He's a very fast starter in the first round in Majors, but will Dustin Johnson strike it third time lucky come Sunday? #Majors #golfchat"
It's Thursday and Dustin Johnson is crushing it at a major. All is right.
"Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson in 2nd, it's a good day"
Next time Dustin Johnson tees off on a Sunday in contention in a Major want him decked out in Godolphin blue #uspga
No surprise: Dustin Johnson had a strong 1st rd Thursday at PGA Championship. Can he sustain it through weekend? http://t.co/goOqMTpsuy
Not sure I could muster the mental strength to play 17 more holes after  doing what Dustin Johnson just did on the 1st. #PGAChampionship
"Of all the things I'm envious of when it comes to professional golfers, Dustin Johnson's strut walk may be at the top of the list."
Really hope Dustin Johnson pulls it out the bag tomorrow and ties up #TheOpen  #Adidas #AdidasGolf
"The 10th hole seems to be a good birdie hole. Dustin Johnson birdies the 10th, his 1st hole to move to -1 #PGAChamp"
Well I pulled a Dustin Johnson on the 18th but I'm proud to say I played the best 9 holes of my life tonight #GoLow http://t.co/zBZR1EfiZC
"Would love to see Dustin Johnson make a huge charge tomorrow, he's got the game"
Dustin Johnson again proves he may be best golfer on the planet on Thursday Friday and Saturday... just not good when matters most. #Sunday.

Ice cube can produce some good movies. We just need another Friday
Ice cube made today was a good day. And wrote and starred in Friday. Today we bump cube.
"If nothing else, Straight Outta Compton was worth it just for Ice Cube laughing at his own script for Friday. Seriously, tho. Amazing film."

@gamespot oh the 5th one in the back is John cena for sure
Fucking JON STEWART just made John Cena lose the match for his 16th world title because he doesn't want Cena to tie Flair. Wrestling's great
I hope Jon Stewart cuts a heel promo tomorrow night calling John Cena the Arby's of wrestling.
I was worried for a bit that John Cena may have been behind the Kennedy assassination because I couldn't see him when it happened.
It would be sick if kc changed the song b4 1st period to john cena's intro song #dr34mz #ucntcme #WRESTLEMANIA
"Most people may hate john cena, but I think that man is hilarious on the mic @JohnCena @WWE"

I'd love to be here and keep rolling on the floor laughing about John Cena... But my Driving Test is tomorrow so a WWE Network replay it is.
I'm sad about going into 6th year so I'm watching John Cena videos and it's helping so much
John cena love you ask a question you will be Monday in wwe ??
Legitimately crying at the KSU football hype video that transitions directly from John Cena's theme to that sad Friday Night Lights music
News in on John Cena possibility hurt at a live event.. Looks like he may have re-injured his nose. Hopefully the rumor is false #wwe #Cena

"That John Cena prank call video may have taken a few years off of my life. I was laughing way too fucking hard, it was horrifying. #WWE"
Thinking I'm absolutely hilarious sat here playing the John Cena theme tune on a recorder
WWE Fans glad thank you @StephMcMahon @WWEUniverse  Sting vs. Seth Rollins John Cena vs. Seth Rollins  Good Luck Sunday Sept 20!
"Was challenged to ""name the wrestler"" on quizup and I read it as ""weather"". was very confuse when the 1st quest included a pic of John Cena"
Which is more important @WWE John cena's 16th title reign to tie or number 17 to break the record
"john cena ,if ua good u will beat john cena for the 1st round BUT FORGET ABT THE 2ND ROUND WE DONT GIVE UP. https://t.co/Eh0AOnKPzu"

You worry about your 2nd amendment america with a nra nut john kasich givin guns like candy its my life i worry about.. wild west mentality.

It's of hilarious that one of the biggest ovations from Thursday was when John Kasich said he wouldn't disown his hypothetical gay son.
John Kasich has sure come out of nowhere. I'd give him the W tonight. Can't wait to watch the Democratic Party's first debate in October.
"John Kasich may not be terribly polished, but he's coming across as more comfortable and real than Jeb Bush. #GOPDebate"
John Kasich seems well balanced and sensible compared to the rest at Thursday night's debate. I say @JohnKasich won.
John Kasich should feel proud of his performance at the #GOPDebate Thursday night. He looked more presidential than the rest of the field.
"John Kasich with the goal posts gesture needs to be on front pages tomorrow. It's a gift. Make me proud, headline writers."
My hope for the two remaining empty podiums on Thursday is Chris Christie and John Kasich.

The Texas Rangers did a nice job today and Josh Hamilton is able to hit his 5th home run and he did a great job today.

"@SebSB @SBerahino I really hope he stays now, Even if Kane dies of exhaustion by November"
@_socoamaretto If Kane doesn't find his Nov-Mar form again I think they could be in for a very bad season. Dier-Mason is the kind of...
"@guyfarmer1978 lol, true. The other striker you do have were trying to take off your hands by Tuesday, lol!! Kane has lost his confidence!"
"@ironviews Good article, and good point about Sakho. He could be sat here now in the same situation as Kane, with people starting to doubt."
Same old same old good till the last 3rd no support for Kane no width fuck knows what Poch is doing ain't got a fucking clue
"Okay so the White Sox suck, Rose and Kane may be sexual predators, and Cobb and Nelson are hurt before game one. Sports suck."
5 teams contact the Blackhawks about Kane... they dont seem to care they may lose him if he's charged ... winning that important to teams?
"@AdamOsper @tonyfowler4  Yes, I'm optimistic but feel we really needed a 2nd striker who could either play alone or link with Kane"
@AdamOsper think you're mad. 6th is only possible if Kane repeats last years feat which is next to impossible
@AndrewGreif Concern's having 5th guy who can play CB; Kane's natural Safety but he played some CB in camp unless others like Tyree will 2/2

@EddyDavis19 and yeah I agree berahino may go on to be massive but with Kane at the club I'd focus on devolving him even more!

"@Hostile_Derek @2ndCityHockey I don't know enough to say for sure, but he may make us not miss saad (if Kane isn't in prison)"
@Iam_Stonewall I'm sure it's going to be Sting. Expecting a Brothers of Destruction reunion too Sunday with Kane helping Taker in his match.
@ImperialDesi Hawks will discipline Kane for sure. But he'll play again for the Hawks. May just have to wait a bit
@JJPhyall @realBenReid I wouldn't be surprised with kane with sting possibly tomorrow
@JW_Burton Kane should of scored and would of made it easy then. Still hope always the important goal is the 1st mate. plenty of time
"@LukeBBurgess not true. Kanes sitter, mason had 2 great chances and kane had another in the 2nd!"
@Potters_1863 @APB1979 I definitely watch a different game than you. England 2nd best 1st half and not that good 2nd half Kane is difference
@Ryan_Davis17 May not have been just find it strange... That's all. I just hope the same protection that came to Kane doesn't come to Rose.
@Spurs2380 Kane may well get so disillusioned with lack of signings that he slaps in a transfer request. That would be interesting!
@Teekosey I'm optimistic about Son. Looks like a great finisher and to have another goal threat may open up some space for Kane
"@_Meredinho I just worry he could go either way 50/50,pretty much like Kane,hoping he has a most important 2nd season,need finished article"
@hotspur423 as fans we should expect 6th and visible improvements in style. He will have to drop Kane for the cups now which is very sad.
@juicysushi @ColinWaters @Inverted_FB @BenoitsSmartCar Kane gets hurt tomorrow. You really want Chadli/Son playing 99% of striker till May?
@pokeefe1 totally agree. After Levy's balls up with getting Berahino we may as well have used Ade as back up to Kane
@russjohns8 @Slinger1970 @_LAPDOG  I've gotta admit I'm not too sure yet about Kane mysen... Got a lot to live up to after that 1st season
"@simonhfootball Yep, Kolarov and Wilson are two I want in for sure. May even get shot of Eriksen as Kane isn't scoring."
"@sloader300 What were Mason's 2 good chances? Kane's 2nd (was that the one creeated by Chadli, where he had 4 bodies to shoot through)?"
@stumpyspurs Man Utd may be forced to go in for Kane or even Austin if they can't lure bigger stars to the club.
"Bradford's Logan Caruso was 2nd in the boys cross country race today in Kane with a time of 18:37, Hunter Yasurek of Kane was 3rd."
Credit where it's due that is a good ball by Mason but I would say the ball is made by Kane's run. He'll score 2 in the 2nd half.
"Dont know what all the worry about kane is for,we all know he doesnt start his season till november!#COYS"
Drives me up a wall that I had to see a Kane article on him being traded on the front page of the Sun Times. Seriously? How dull are people?
"Fair play to Kane, he managed to control the ball and score against virtually a sunday league keeper. Top notch"
"Good read (by @DTguardian) about Kane laughing off ""one season wonder"" comments: http://t.co/NgjNulL7BM"
Harry Kane and Barkley are the most overhyped English talents going. 2nd season syndrome for Kane for sure
"I wanted him on the Blackhawks so much. Instead, the blue line has no depth. Kruger is unsigned. Kane may not play.. https://t.co/IchQQ5dPs9"
"If I was Walcott, Sterling or Kane sat on the bench, I'd be insulted that Vardy is playing over me. A hard worker, but not international lvl"
Kane and Walcott both come off bench to score on Saturday then get rewarded by......errrrrrr sitting back on the bench #woyproblems #Eng
"Kane may have made it 5-0, I may have lost my bet. But guess what, I can speak properly, Harry Kane can't."
Kane oh no...I sub Kane for lukaku now he scores..... Rooney won't score tomorrow to complete a bad FPL week
"Kane should have scored, but Howard made a great play on that (and the Toby header). Optimistic for the 2nd Half! #COYS"
"Kane to get injured on international duty this weekend, Adebayor to make a miraculous comeback to fire Spurs to 4th #LevyMasterplan"
Kane's confidence is sky high.. Odds on Kaboul to have the game the game of his life Sunday and him to be lost in his pocket?
Listening to the full interview now. Hoping there's some context to the Kane remarks. https://t.co/3mUgEENB1G
Not sure Archie is to interested in this drab England performance. Kane on 2nd half. Maybe he can play with Rooney http://t.co/nxClns3XAA
"Not sure why Kane didn't start, he's miles infront of Vardy and also needs more international experience and goals for Tuesday game!!"
"One season wonders don't tend to do it in their 1st season when only 21. Ridiculous that ppl even consider it. Kane is class, get used to it"
"Only good thing about getting up at 6 on a Saturday is having an extra 6 hours to ponder on Mr fantasy team, Kane in or out... #dilemma"
"Play Clinton up front over Kane. He's not on it, still tired imo, give him October off."
"Practice Today At Kane, Players be there 2:45 make sure everyone's there, review for scrimmage on Saturday !"
St. Marys' Michelle Bauer won the girls cross country race vs. Kane and Bradford in 19:21. Amanda Foster of St. Marys was 2nd at 21:10.
With Spurs not signing a striker and Kane about to get injured on Saturday palace have an even better chance of making Europe this season
http://t.co/YjKAvbkM5M twsrc^tfw abc7chicago Doesn't look good for Kane and the Blackhawks
@BrendanWadlow still see Koivu. You even admitted it was a good comparison like a month back. Kane may be a better one though.
"@PeteSchaad @footysoldiers and he was 4th top scorer in Prem last yr after Kun, Kane and Costa honestly surprised no one signed him #vhappy!"
"@Sirled26 Indeed, hopefully Kane's England success gives his season kick-start it needed. 3 points absolutely vital on Sunday, nothing less."
@TheRomanAnoai you've listened good man your 1st tip is to eliminate all allys to seth rollins... J &amp; J / Kane / Triple H / Steph Mcmahon.
@foo fighters going to be a great day at Murrayfield please say happy 21st birthday to Kane that would top off his day
@foofighters on our way to Edinburgh it's our son Kane's 21st -we brought him up on great music! Please say happy birthday.thanks guys
"GLEN HODDLE: Harry Kane's impact Friday was extraordinary. It was great to see Kane, the leading Premier League scorer, come on and score"
GOAL! Kane 1-0 England   His 3rd in 4 internationals. Shaw with a great pull back and Kane slams it home with his left.   #ENGvSWI
I am really hoping the #preds aren't one of the 5 teams that called about trading for Kane. Not sure we have enough room for 3rd chances.
"I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/aCZISHWQI0 Josh Mathews questions the look AJ gave Kane: Raw June 4,"
I think some spurs may just be 0 betraying the abilities of Charlie Austin. We need a different option upfront. Too much like Kane #THFC
"Kane finding form at the right time, ready to score twice against Sunderland on Sunday..."
Kane with a brilliant finish tonight as England win 2-0 . let's hope he takes his performance into the game on Sunday http://t.co/S6GPyhbC3N
"My son is walkin out with the ENG team tomorrow night,told him under no circumstances can he b holding hands with Kane,am I right 2 say that"
Pretty sure Kane will interfere on Sunday in the Taker/Lesnar match and Taker wins then they have a rubber match and Les nar wins.
Well done H its good to see you score again. like to see Kane and Son team up Hint Hint! keep going https://t.co/slm8vaprCN

@Phoenvvx sure. Even Kendrick lost it towards the end of his Black Friday freestyle ( and this isn't me hating).
Both dope songs but Kendrick has a message Future just goin dumb on auto tune  https://t.co/pqIhnFhFNR
Damn dawg you weak ass niggas are really berating Kendrick. https://t.co/svYNcP7SqN
Honestly only bad thing I can say about the Kendrick album were the roll out of singles and what ones were picked 1st
I'll hate on Kendrick all fucking day but that Black Friday freestyle is fucking legendary
Kendrick made sure iggy wasn't going to steal his bars when he snapped on Black Friday.
Kendrick's 2015 album may be important but it's not especially listenable. Future sounds like a guy playing with a microphone at Best Buy.
That August Alsina album is dope. Most artists' sophomore album isn't as good as the first (*cough* Kendrick *cough*) but this joint fire
"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think that ever since the Grammy's snubbed Kendrick the first time,they just throwing awards at him"
While we're on the topic.... J. Cole &gt; Kendrick   As far as Black Friday is concerned... Go debate ya fat aunt who only wears elastic pants
Yo it's been 2 and a half weeks since Kendrick's Black Friday dropped and I still haven't fully understood all his lyrics yet...
@cavenigger hes got a new mixtape?? Or u mean the small black friday thing with kendrick
@cheyenethomas2 only the intro? Man you missing out and the only thing weak about J. Coles Black Friday was Kendrick's beat...
@leahmoloney so with you buy tickets for Saturday to see Flo you'll only see her and Kendrick (I'm not sure but it's what I understood when
@richierich65 the Kendrick album may be the most overrated album of all time. It's a good album but very little replay value
Boy I bet Kendrick is glad he didn't go for that 2nd cup of coffee before calling TLR on Greinke. #minutesaway #Dbacks
I stanned Kendrick heavy Dec-Feb should I be happy about this and call everyone favs irrelevant? https://t.co/LB8mZ9F1rn
"Kendrick has become a lot more covert with his ""wokeness"" that most ""woke"" listeners may have felt comfortable with in his pre-TPAB music..."
Like I heard so many people complain about Kendrick's flow on TPAB but loved Black Friday. When he used the same EXACT flows in that.
Listen Kendrick hard but that last Album was weak af yal can remove yal lips from his dick cause the 1st Album was wayyyyyy harder
You can't even compare Kendrick and Future. Way different. Future just got fire beats. K Dot got Barzzzzz  https://t.co/ar3hfswGMK

"I love refinding amazing songs. In 9th grade( now im a junior) i loved SOO many amazing rap songs like Memories back then with Kendrick, bob"
"I may need to fact check, but I'm pretty sure that Kendrick is only the 2nd rapper to have his 1st 2 albums nominated for AOTY."
"I purchase Kendrick, Cole, August, Lito, Drake etc. they give you records that mean something, that relate to life"
I'm pretty sad that this is the first time I've heard Black Friday by Kendrick and J.cole
"I've been listening to J Cole's and Kendrick's Black Friday.I mean even if it isn't a collaborative project, let the niggas drop some fire."
If Kendrick and Cole drop they're album in February watch Drake drop his a week after just to kill there buzz. That would smart marketing

Kpop fandoms may hate eachother but if ppl keep provoking Queens it's just going to make those same fandoms wanna vote for T-ara.
"Please don't get us wrong, KPOP groups won't come to Barcelona on September 26. It's just a KPOP meeting organized by fanbases :)"
The language may be different but Kpop's genres with western musics are just the same. Stop acting like it's from outer space.
Wouldn't say shes in the elite or top singers in KPOP now but goes to show how big 1st impressions or one bad moment in negative light lasts
"like c'mon, Kpop fans vote almost everyday, for every music shows + award shows at the end of the year + different polls. We live by voting"
15 feminine stars who may make a just right boyfriend | Oh! Kpop stars celebrity news and gossip! http://t.co/9uA12lN3R6
@1D5_69 @_infinitehoran_ I've been a fan for 4 years now. KPOP is kinda different from what you may be used to. T-ARA is my FAVE group!
@AhlemMadani really send ur story to SM or Kyuhyun they may give you a full paid trip to see them XD really that's the good effect of KPOP!
@Scxrrr do not get into kpop  u may or may not be able to control urself and the storage in ur phone bc of saving too much pics

@robotovee yeah i still remember their HQ at Hongdae. So small. So happy that they r the 3rd largest company in Kpop now
@tifftiffannie haha 8th - 11th grade was strong with the Kpop. We're always in sync lol
Am I the only one thinking that Kpop used to be so fun back then? I mean the 2nd Generation was the best.
"Happy Birthday My 1st namja bias in Kpop, Lee Taemin, Taem i love u, i miss u in the past #HappyTaeminDay"

#Cubs Kris Bryant is starting in right field for the Cubs on Monday.  http://t.co/Q1qiobeqlu
@ChiKidChris17 picking  MVP in July is stupid ..wow were you marking off the days on your I luv Kris Bryant calendar to retweet this ? lol
@finkn23 He is an advanced college guy but even Kris Bryant didn't see the bigs til his 3rd pro season. Zimmer is great but no Bryant.
"@or_lce For me it's ok if Duffman finishes 2nd behind Kris Bryant (I really like him for NLROY), but if he wins it, I'll be happy :)"
"Aug 2, AB 3: Brewers challenged (tag play), call on the field was upheld: Kris Bryant singles on a line drive to center fielder Shane"
"I hope Kris Bryant is ready for a ""random"" drug test tomorrow. Or do they only do that in the NFL?"
"Im a Cubs fan, if I find out tomorrow Kris Bryant worshipped the Cardinals, I wouldnt care one bit....strange phenomenon"
"Kris Bryant hurt, Joe Maddon ejected in today's Cubs game, and it's only the 6th inning. http://t.co/lzil9Z8SnK http://t.co/avErYtjRJB"
"Kris Bryant quickly goes 0-2, works the count full, then hits hits 2nd home run of the day to dead center. #BryantForROY"
Kris Bryant said last Wednesday was the hottest game he's ever played in. How bad is it there today?
Kris Bryant sneaks one just above Ryan Braun's glove into the right field basket. 16th of the year. 1-1 i the 2nd. #Cubs
Rizzo walks runners on 1st &amp; 2nd no outs let's keep the line going be patient wait for that pitch don't chase Kris Bryant up alright Bryant
Seattle lost last night which brought Tuesday to a close at 2-4 at -$50. The Rockies ML was make or break even and Kris Bryant answered.
Sox fans that are happy that Kris Bryant left the game with an injury are pretty pathetic! C'mon guys really?!? We are better than that!
That ball Kris Bryant just hit is the 2nd farthest ball I've ever seen hit. He is officially ridiculous.
Wake up to not really caring that Kris Bryant hit a walk off. Caring that the Cubs gave up 4 stinking runs in the top of the 9th.
"@michaelbdiamond @JorgeSoler68 @CubsJoeMadd @Cubs September sounds good... 9/26 is kris Bryant bobblehead day, could be a good one!"
Can you believe it?! Kris Bryant and the Cubs walk off in the 9th!! 5 in a row!! Lester pitched great and we... http://t.co/ELvEUMLZC8
Cubs win! Walk off home run in the 10th by the blue eyed killa Kris Bryant!
I attended Tulo's final game in a Rockies uniform tonight. And witnessed a Kris Bryant walk-off homer. Not a bad Monday.
I love Kris Bryant. The way he plays 3rd is Santo-esque. But  damn that was a nice play by Herrerra
"I'm so excited for the Cubs game tomorrow! I can't wait! Jon Lester on the hill, Kris Bryant just feet away, and a pennant chase! #WeAreGood"
I'm surprised that was only Harper's 3rd walk of the year after falling behind 0-2. Kris Bryant leads baseball with 10.
If Kris Bryant becomes Chris Davis are #Cubs fans mad? I would take that. Davis this season 6th in homers leads the AL in RBI.
"If it ain't broke don't fix it, why move kris Bryant up to 3rd when he's hitting as good as he has all season at 5"
Kris Bryant belted a two-run walk-off homer with two outs in the ninth Monday night to power the Cubs to a 9-8... http://t.co/WLHUHx3ZRh
Kris Bryant injured sliding into 2nd after RBI. Hope he is ok #Cubs
Kris Bryant is 16th in MLB in WAR as a rookie. Love when people say he's having a bad year
Kris Bryant is pretty good at baseball. I think he just might have a future in it. #youhearditherefirst https://t.co/sSmIvCix4S
"Kris Bryant sent Cubs fans home happy Monday, belting a walk-off, solo home run in the ninth inning versus the Indians."
Kris Bryant singles. That must feel good. B2B singles. Men on 1st and 2nd with one out.
Kris Bryant will make October 7th come faster don't worry everyone.
"Lester goes 8 and 2/3 strong, gives up a run in 9th. Kris Bryant hits a walk off to win, Lester doesn't get the W. Heartbreaking for owners!"
"Still hyped rn! Kris Bryant is my favorite player, he got his 1st walk off homer, the Cubs got an important W and are staying in the hunt"
Thank you Joey Votto... Thank you my good friend.. and thanks for that 4th out Kris Bryant... how you doin Cubbies?? HaHa  #serieswin #Reds

@Flipkart @MotorolaIndia Flipkart isn't letting me exchange my Moto G 2nd gen mobile. They are cancelling my orders. You just lost a buyer.

@SkySportsTennis Murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing Djokovic
@SkySportsTennis it's a joke! Troicki v young into a 5th set and on Sky go we are forced to watch Murray walking into the practice court???
Beginning to worry Murray may be stuck on two grand slams for the rest of his career.
"Booo, Murray gets broke early in the 2nd set. It's not as if he's playing bad, Anderson is playing exceptional tennis here. #USOpen"
I LOVE how aggressive both Serena &amp; Venus are being off the 2nd serve return. Murray would lose this match! @cbfowler @bgtennisnation
If Murray loses this 2nd set I'm pretty sure he won't win this.
"Murray in real trouble now, down a break in the 3rd #USOpen Looking angry and frustrated"
Murray misses a good chance to break at the start of the 4th. Sloppy along with a brilliant shot from Anderson denies the break. #USOpen
"#SNews Shakes: Don't worry we're still in it, Mathoho &amp; Coetzee out, Boks all fit, Honda/McLaren split? Kev v Murray, Isner v Fed 4th Rnd."
1 set up and has already broken Murray in the 2nd. This is beautiful from Kevin
3 unforced errors for Andy Murray against 17 forAnderson yet Murray chucks away the 1st set with a careless double fault in the tie break.
6 match points in a row now for Anderson in the 4th set tie breaker; surely Murray has lost this... #USOpen #FlushingMeadows
@AndrewLightle Murray just got obliterated in the 4th set tiebreak
"@AnthonyLGargano I'm glad McCoy isn't on the Eagles anymore, he's such a hater. 1st he talked crap about Kelly now talking about Murray."
@HibernianRetro @Fritz1875 The mic batteries are running out! Murray 3-1 up 2nd set with a break. Matchsticks needed for my eyes here!
@Lennyfrigginleo won the game with out Allen in the 4th we would have lost murray had 0 points I do think they needed to settle Allen down
@Nef77_NEFL @NEFL_Chiefs See I dont see that really...yeah Murray lost 5 fumbles the 1st 5gms... Didnt have another the next 11
@RonanMMurray are you having a sneaky Monday night drink Murray?
"@UltimateTennis_ he better close it in 3, not making much 1st serves and Murray seems winning all 2nd serves..important serve game to start?"
"@darrenrovell They have a very weak evening schedule tonight (Murray &amp; Halep), &amp; Serena in the afternoon tomorrow"
@kevinanderson18 2-1 up in the 4th with serve and 2-1 up in sets. Murray jumpy like his had a mustard enema.  #USOpen
@kevinanderson18 plays terrific TB &amp; wins it with big off fh winner 7-5. Murray with plenty of work to do now as sun goes down.
"@ruzkin @redscribe I'm away at Write Around the Murray this weekend, but free next Monday (14th) and the Thursday after that."
"Finally, on the 5th attempt, Anderson wins the second set 6-3, serving his 12th ace for the match to lead 2 sets to love against Murray."

"Hello Tuesday, I had a nice looooong weekend, now it's time to work. (at @Lowes Home Improvement in Murray, KY) https://t.co/XAimNoODOY"
I'm afraid of Murray though... He beat Belluci with ease in the 3rd round. Kevin's strong point is his serves!
I'm sure Murray will win the 3rd set but not sure if he would win the match.
"It just wasn't going to be Murray's tournament. A head cold, 2 very tricky 1st and 2nd round opponents and an inspired Anderson performance"
"Maybe Sunday was just a funny day for tennis, Murray on getting over a cold: ""My voice feels like normal again. Still dull, obviously."""
Murray can't be happy with that tie-break esp. What did he need to do better this match? #usopen https://t.co/aThIQd6RlI
Murray down 0-30 but strings four in a row to stay alive. Up 6-5.  Can break here to win the set and serve first again in the 2nd...
Murray is 28 and at his peak. Not sure he can win another major. He may have to be content with his Wimbledon &amp; US Open wins. #murray
"Murray is so flat atm, if Anderson can get inspired at the start of the 2nd he can take control of this match."
Murray just lost 2nd set and camera stayed on him during changeover. I counted 11 f-words in 20 seconds. New record?
Murray loses the 1st point. Anderson playing courageous tennis from the baseline. 27 Winners to Murray's 12 #USOpen Can he keep it up ??
"Murray two sets to love down. Think the broadcaster may want to turn the volume down, quiet a few F's coming from Murray! #USOpen2015"
"Not getting a good run with frees for, another goal to Murray from a free kick 16 points up midway through 2nd"
"Not the best start to the 2nd set from Murray, but our print editor is more focused on the fact that apparently both players ""look scruffy"""

"i dont know if this match is live btwn Anderson&amp;Murray, but Murray take the 3rd set...he's kinda frustrated but still...Go Andy!!! #USOpen"
murray break back anderson wud be stupid sha 2 allow a double break I expect it 2 get 2 5-3 and he serves out the 2nd set leaving it at 6-3
@Betweenthehedge @VivianJo1 @cosmosmom1952 Don't you just love them to pieces?!?! Murray is my 3rd. I can only handle one at a time tho. lol
"@KCChiefs_58 well, I think KC may have a good QB for the future in Murray."
@LewisKing__ @LouisWhyman @DCBlueStar I'm saying Murray was good but it great. Randle and dmc are just as good if it better. CM is 4th RB
@MurrayBarnett thanks for hosting us Murray. Had a great time. Good luck for the cup. May the best team win. They usually do.
"@SeanTierneyTSS If Murray comes back well, he'll be the 2nd/3rd best D maybe Johnson. I'd want him for the Leafs for sure."
@SkySportsTennis it's why I love tennis. One minute looks like murray is down and out. Next minute anything is possible! C'mon @andy_murray
A good  hold from Murray. 5-3 in 2nd. How is Anderson's head coping with this now?
Bellucci played a great 3rd set but Murray was just too good. He advances into week 2 with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 7-5 win #TeamMurray #usopen
Come on Murray dig deep...I'm going to be tired for work tomorrow if I have to stay up for a 5-setter @SkySportsTennis
Good straight sets win for Murray last night hope he kicks on from here and good chance of winning the #USOpen for a 2nd time
"Happy 6th birthday to Murray who celebrates with us @Falkirkbairns today! We hope you, your friends and family enjoy your special day!"
"Just as I say how good Anderson has been, Murray goes 3-1 up in the 3rd. Of course. #USOpen"
Morning from #Woking where it is a dull start but hoping for sun to break through later. Couldn't stay up for end of Murray's match. :(
Mr. Murray gave me some really great life advice in the 7th grade and I was too much of a little douchebag to appreciate it.
Murray gets the break he needed. Even's things in the 3rd. Anderson has 3 sets to fail if Murray hopes to win.
Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray
Murray now holds to love and he levels the 4th set at 5-5. Pressure straight back on Anderson. His longest match at the Open #USOpen
Murray struggling at moment but I think he'll come strong in 3rd &amp; 4th set to take it to decider #USOpen2015
"Piers Newbery : @piersnewbery:  Murray breaks back in the 3rd, huge roar, crowd loving it. Not sure Lamps expe...... http://t.co/HRAiTsXvzq"
"Really great match this now. Anderson is going for broke on every Murray 2nd serve, and Murray is winning most rally points now. #USOpen2015"
Superb from Anderson. Good fight from Murray as always. 2nd serve just ain't strong enough imo.
This Murray vs Anderson match is great. 4 hour match and it's still in the 4th set.
"We're going to a 4th set!! Murray just dominated that tiebreak, wins it 7-2. He's pumped up now!! #USOpen2015 #Murray"

Niall had sex gave you tickets thats not love love is when he protects u he takes u on dates he wouldnt put u in the 7th row of the concert
"This fandom's a mess omg, I wouldn't be surprise if tomorrow there's a trend who says Niall's going to marry his cousin #WeKnowTheTruth"
When September 13 comes along I know I'll be forgotten..  just don't be surprised when Niall gets assassinated
Why are Niall and Camila even trending?? I bet Directioners are just really bored!! GO STUDY!! YOU HAVE SCHOOL ON MONDAY!!
if i sat beside niall i would be so annoyed bc he looks like he chews his gum annoyingly loud  http://t.co/Zc5NPTGJgD
"2nd Round: Guess the song  He treats you so bad and I'm so good to you, It's not fair!  First to 5 points gets the DM with Niall!!"
"@MrsAnneTwist the last time they hit Niall's injured knee, this time Harry's head! They may really hurt them! This NEEDS to stop!"
@NiallOfficial calm down Niall she don't want 7th row tickets
"@angkeats @hstyIespics H may try. Liam would be confused; Louis would just take the piss, and Niall would probably laugh tbh"
@farahbieber123 the sun released fake articles that the boys are breaking up but then Niall and Louis confirmed they rnt
"@uansfIirt yeah, i'm aware, i just meant that we have like no information about her, all we know is she may have hooked up with niall"
"Hi Niall, Can you wish me good luck because tomorrow I have to do an operation to my foot and I'm really scared! X5"
I can grantee you that Niall and Camila are not dating. I mean you don't just ask a girl out randomly at a concert when you sat her once.
I feel bad for Niall girls because Niall hooked up with a girl and gave her his number and 7th row tickets for their concert... stay strong
I had a dream I went to another otra show but Niall was sick and couldn't come so I just sat the whole time except during the fireworks
I may be mean with niall's legs sometimes but it doesnt mean i dont care
"I met Harry, Liam and Niall on 26 March, the day right after Zayn announced he's leaving, the boys looked heartbroken #5monthswithoutzayn"
I'm going to be so sad if I get to go to niall's hotel again on Saturday and he leaves like twenty minutes after I do again
"Niall e Camila . They are just frinds guys c'mon she is a ""fan"" l mean she is like us so stop it"
Niall faced serious bullying problems as a kid. He got suspended in the 3rd grade for swinging when somebody called him ugly
Niall is going through mood swings right now so hopefully he's all good by tomorrow night
Niall is sick so he may not be out a lot. -A
"Niall is wearing the leg brace on stage. He may be injured and from the looks of it, no jumping for tonight! :( #OTRAMontreal"
"Niall posts three pictures in a day. None of them are of him. Tuesday, why are you so cruel?"
Niall: plays song from 5th album Louis: Niall you're a bad bad boy
but if I don't go to the game tomorrow and Niall does go I'll be very upset
rip me. I'm going to be so tired tomorrow plus HOW WILL I BE ABLE TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE WHEN CAMILA AND NIALL DID A THING
"+ peed in a fancy bathroom, sat in GR8 seats, saw one direction, Niall n Harry loved it there, got a glow stick, a hot cop goofed off w me +"

I hope I meet the boys on Saturday &amp; I hope Niall follows me &amp; @niaIloncraic &amp; @blackbownjh !!!!!
I hope Liam comes out tonight with balloons like Niall did for his 21st but on his arm how cute was that

I hope Niall's day was better than the other day.hope tomorrow goes good also
I love waking up from a long ass dream of meeting Niall...........(it was so real and different than Sunday morning I'm soooo)
I met Camila back in April. My DNA on her hands. I love hanging out with Niall
I miss Niall so much he made me so happy on Saturday I felt at home and god I want to go back
"Louis and Harry love home Sunday roast. Liam loves curry, while Niall loves all the food in general"
"Luckily the boys don't have a show tomorrow, really hope Niall will feel better soon :("
"Niall is probably going to see 5sos tomorrow in NJ, love my luck :))"
"Niall is so beautiful his blue eyes, his smile he shines like a star or a sun he makes my day he's just so unconventionally beautiful."
Niall is so freaking cute j can't just imagine him sat there on his phone/laptop scrolling through all our tweets and laughing to himself
Niall on april 24th 2015 the best day he looked so good
Niall posted a pic of his hairy leg in the sun and im like wtf the fuck why so I scrolled and there was Zayn's beautiful face thank u
"On Niall's birthday on Sunday the 13th, we should all tweet a video on why we love and appreciate him. #HappyBirthdayNiall"
Today is 27 August meaning @opianjh has otra today and I hope she has the bestest time ever and that Niall wears this http://t.co/pPeUwq48Rq
Why is everyone talking about Niall's bday it's not until the 13th ok I have 8 more days until I panic bc he's 22
do you know that moment when you stare at the sun and your eyes start to cry because it's so bright? that happens to me when i look at Niall

"we don't get enough Niall in yellow, I don't like the color but he looks like the sun in it #MTVHottest One Direction"
@NiallOfficial Hello Niall i love you so much you make me smile make me better may you please kindly follow me i hope you have a fab day 3
All I want in life is to meet Niall tomorrow but I'm 10000% sure that won't happen
@MileyCyrus I dreamed about katy perry dragging Nicki's back for you on sunday and it was very fatal. I hope it's gonna happen
@TMZ Miley may act and be the way she is but she is a good person. Nicki is the one looking for fights anywhere. Embarrassing...
"All Nicki said was ""what's good"" like c'mon now we get it she a bad bitch ok"
"And tomorrow Nicki is going to be seen as ""a raging angry black women"" for calling Miley out of something that she is GUILTY for"
Do you guys remember that not too long ago Nicki was like one of the most hated artist.. During her Pink Friday album
I'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and Nicki is being the shady bitch queen she is and I just lost all focus
"Miley is the 8th most hated person in America, idk why y'all are acting like Nicki gets more hate than Miley"
"So whats good Miley? @MileyCyrus ...lol Nicki with that fuck shit,we may as well make a song about it. Hit me up. I ghost write like Quentin"
"5SOS won, Taylor &amp; Nicki had a duet, Nicki looked like she wanted to beat the crap out of Miley. Waking up to this, Monday is good for once!"
@BaconBitsBitch lol.. I agree w Nicki and Sammy 1st and second Miley might be doing good deeds OK but she's literally a fucking mess. So shh
"@DaRealAmberRose hey amber are you free November 14th. I asked Nicki but her best friend told me she has a boyfriend, that's clear."
@OnikaThot Nicki was trying to or the producers told her to discredit Mariah there and Mariah sat her bc she's still more successful
"@dquintia_ Nicki's role may be essential, but it is not a role to defend publicly. Do you get what I mean?"
"@eh_kees perception is 9/10th of reality. Because we perceive Meek as ""not good enough"" for Nicki. His support looks like he is star struck"
@zackrorz but people hated way before then tbh and I think it may have been directed at lil' Kim other than Iggy because Nicki denied later
All the talk will be about Nicki and Miley tomorrow. Nothing else has been talk worthy. #VMAs
Azealia Banks may find herself in another hot situation after she involved herself in the Miley Cyrus and Nicki... http://t.co/BUZ6UjCoCD
"But Miley, what IS good? I think Nicki needs an answer on her desk by tomorrow morning if you wanna keep ya scalp."
"Can't wait to see the lame ass ""think pieces"" about how Nicki is ""an angry black woman"" and how she was ""mean"" to Miley tomorrow"
Damn.... Miley Cyrus needs to watch it that bitch is gonna get sat on and crushed by Nicki.
"I do have some complaints about this this beautiful Sunday night. First, miley handled that well. Nicki should be... http://t.co/4pAjjyTGhd"
I don't think Nicki's pregnant. Stomach was flat again in the side view. Think she was just sticking her butt out in the 1st pic.
I get that marriage equality probably isn't an issue that directly affects Nicki so she may focus on it less...
I still think they should have let Nicki continue what she was going to say rather then cut her off cuz it may hurt Miley's feelings
"I think sure Nicki may have been joking though, if she had real beef I feel like it would be a lil scarier."
"I'm a bit annoyed about what miley said about nicki. Taylor started the pop star against pop star war, nicki didn't even sat her name"
I'm literally nervous for what Kanye may say tonight...he more of a loose cannon than Nicki
If the weeknd doesn't clear up the rumors about him disliking black women tomorrow I might have to pull a kayne on him then pull a Nicki
Like Miley said she didn't look into everything but she thought Nicki may have been subbing her but she didn't know for sure. Her words.
Lol watch how the media paints Nicki as an angry black woman tomorrow morning and miley as the victim #bye
"Lol. You can still watch, Nicki asked Miley what's good and called her a bitch (most interesting part of the show) https://t.co/tCIdK88LtI"
Miley was a child actor.I'm sure most of the net worth is from the Hannah Montana days.C'mon now. Don't play Nicki.  https://t.co/ovhZyCwYOy
Nicki &amp; Tay may be friends but I'm still not a fan like was Nicki for real about Miley this is too much for my emotions Im so confused #VMAs
Nicki may have called Miley out but Miley's messages tonight were much more powerful than any performance at the VMAs
Nicki's pastor is mad af right now. And it's Sunday smh
Okay....I'll admit it...Taylor did a good job performing with Nicki...I will be performing my own lobotomy tomorrow....Bye
School tomorrow is gonna be fired up HA! you got something to say bad about Nicki? Prepare your argument you're bout to get shut down
The sad part about this is tomorrow Nicki will be the angry black woman who went after poor white girl Miley
What I love most about this is that every hag will be on DCUM tomorrow talking a t how trashy Nicki or Bey is. When clearly...#VMAs
What's good this Thursday? #TBT to Nicki and Miley's heated exchange at the #VMAs! #MileyWhatsGood : https://t.co/dPVOiXezx8
White feminism will be all over the newspapers tomorrow saying how Nicki attacked Miley. That's you call someone out!!!!
im just honestly sat here in awe at nicki haters. like legit how can you hate her for calling someone out for talking shit about her
tomorrow all the headlines are going to be about how Nicki had such an ~aggressive outburst~
watching the VMAs tomorrow just so I can watch Nicki call Miley out on her dumb shit
@Likeitornotmama @jda927 Lil Kim will be remembered as the 3rd/4th most successful female rapper. Nicki will/is the 1st. Numbers don't lie.
@NICKIMINAJ hey Nicki i was going to wish you happy independence on monday from Trinidad
@NickiHunter happy humpday Nicki enjoy your Wednesday. Super love and miss you. Xoxo sweetpea
@TeaMasterT People need to full-stop stop using that for White characters. Full-stop. It's EXACTLY what Nicki criticized in the 1st place.
"@ZeusBarker true, but she was flapping her gums, I'm glad Nicki sat her down. Someone needed to show her what she said was foul."
"@mari_fminaj @THEQUEEN0FRAPI do not know, Pink Friday has the best song Nicki: Super Bass but the pinkprint has invincible like Anaconda"
Everyone in my feminist studies class was team Nicki AND the Mitski tinydesk was released today WHAT A MONDAY !!!!
"I feel like so much happened on the VMAs.  Kanye, Taylor, Nicki and Miley, Miley released new music.. The news is gonna be CRAY tomorrow."
I have a feeling that Nicki's performance at the VMAs  will be the only good one tomorrow
I hope Nicki attends the Givenchy show Friday.
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/oyey81EYQ5 Nicki Minaj - Dear Old Nicki with lyrics - Pink Friday
I love Nicki and Miley and may need to call in sick tomorrow because of it
I may not love all of nicki's music but she is queen
I start school tomorrow and I'm only going because I don't want Nicki to be mad at me
I used to bump Nicki aalllll the time in middle school. Pink Friday was my fav
I want Nicki to fight Miley on a national awards show so bad and tonight may be the night
I'm Team Nicki but I would never openly say something bad about Taylor Swift because I think she may have snipers on retainer.
Nicki fighting all the rich flat ass divas 1st Taylor swift now miley cyrus
Nicki getting hood just then gave me so much motivation to go to school tomorrow and get good grades and go to college I'm so alive
Nicki is a great woman I don't care what you say. I may don't like her music a lot but she's very intelligent.
"Nicki is truly a loving and forgiving God, may we all show the same mercy she has shown to taylor to those who have wronged us. Amen."
Nicki may not be a vocalist but she sure doesn't sound a mess when she sings  https://t.co/MumZ7ZKK8c
Pretty sure Nicki's ass is the 8th wonder of the world
"Professor: ""read 8 chapters by Friday"" Me: @ Nicki I hope you know I'm doing this for you"
Remember the times we used to fast forward songs to Nicki's parts? Now she'll slay with a 3rd album out. Onika gurl. I love it.
What a great weekend. First Drake was in the 'Ville Saturday then Nicki went for Miley's life tonight. What a time to be alive
"What makes me sad is how tomorrow morning, the media is gonna portray Nicki as the stereotypical ""angry black woman"" &amp; make Miley the victim"
Why do y'all want Nicki to be pregnant so bad like maybe around the 7th album but she's literally still in her prime.
"Y'all was gna be mad at Nicki anyway. She just stole all the headlines for tomorrow, keep fuming bitches! New Queen of the VMA's."
"hi Nicki u famous n I know, but ama keep it short. I love u dearly, though u n d world may think am crazy cos De say I write blindly."
i can literally feel my vision improving because of nicki and kanye!! tomorrow i will be such a good day!!
i'm glad Nicki called Miley out but tomorrow the media gone have Nicki looking like another angry black woman. smh.
"yeah i love Nicki and yeah Miley may have said something but Miley has a point, journalists always manipulate what is said, Nicki just"
#SamDubose rest in peace. May you be liberated from suffering and attain complete nirvana. My prayers are with you.

Not a great start for the amateur Paul Dunne. Imagine having to compose yourself to hit your third ball (5th shot) off the tee on hole 2!
"@JamieRKinnin Its wide open at the Open Championship, should be a cracker tomorrow, good luck to amateur Paul Dunne who started at 1,500/1"
@notthefakeSVP  who was the dork asking Paul Dunne what will be your thought in the first tee tomorrow. What a stupid question that was
Don't worry Paul Dunne will slap it around 78 times tomorrow
I hope Paul Dunne blows up tomorrow only because UAB beats us in the tourney... #stillnotoverit
"I hope Paul Dunne doesn't collapse tomorrow, so many contenders for the jug going into final round! #TheOpen"
I hope Paul Dunne steadies the ship. Glad he didn't have to play either of the provisionals on the 2nd. #TheOpen2015
"If Paul Dunne wins the Open tomorrow as an amateur, the transitive property tells me that I also have a good chance of winning it. #Science"
It's a shame it's not a historic march up the 18th on the final Sunday for Paul Dunne. Hopefully he be in as strong a position tomorrow. ...
Keep it going Paul Dunne. Managed to get on him earlier when his odds were enormous. Same again tomorrow will be laughing. #TheOpen2015
Not sure my eyesight can handle the prospect of lookalikes Jordan Spieth and Paul Dunne playing together tomorrow
"Paul Dunne after birdie on 10: ""Cool to lead the Open on the back nine on Sunday. A different kind of Sunday, but..."""
Paul Dunne looked embarrassed after that round and to be at the top of the leaderboard as an amateur! Good luck for tomorrow! #TheOpen2015
"Paul Dunne's gonna puke on the first tee tomorrow. God love the kid, but he doesn't have any idea what he's in for tonight/tomorrow morning"
"To be clear, Paul Dunne isn't ""missing out"" on potential prize money.  He was never competing for that prize money in the 1st place."
Tom Rinaldi didn't want to end his interview with Paul Dunne until Dunne was properly intimidated by tomorrow. Way to drive it home Tom.
1500:1 Vegas odds on Paul Dunne actually making it to the final rnd.. No matter what happens be proud!! Go get it Mon bud!! #AmateurChampion

"Hats off to Paul Dunne there, played some great Golf today, deserves to be in the final grouping tomorrow. #TheOpen2015"
How can you not root for Paul Dunne tomorrow? With all the mini tours I didn't think there were amateurs capable of contending at a major.
If Paul Dunne wins tomorrow I'm going to feel stupid for not betting a dollar on him #1500-1ods

"Paul Dunne is going to be so nervous tomorrow, awesome he's in that position though. Hope he has a chance to win late tomorrow!"
Paul Dunne is tied for 1st at the open and he's a proud #UABBlazer   shutout to my ace @naive_n_sassy  #BlazerLife
"Paul Dunne living the dream! Shame he's gonna have to pull a sickie from work tomorrow, hope his boss turns a blind eye! #TheOpen2015"
Paul Dunne may only get a silver medal if he wins #TheOpen today but one suspects he won't need to worry about money for a while if he does.
"Paul Dunne with a great quote post round on his thoughts on the 1st tee tomorrow leading the Open ... ""Make contact."""
Pic: This guy will make a nice profit if Paul Dunne wins the golf tomorrow http://t.co/tOqK4PCWK3 http://t.co/86i5A7lhrl
Please feel free to jump on the bandwagon tomorrow and support Paul Dunne. Off 2.30pm. #longlunch #proudmoment
Really hope Paul Dunne pulls off an Open Championship victory tomorrow. Rooting for the amateur!
Really torn on the final round tomorrow. I'd love to see Day finally get his major or for Paul Dunne to take it. Still want Spieth though
"So hope that, at the 18th, Paul Dunne makes that classic walk, knowing his putt could win The Open. What a story..."
Some day at #TheOpen2015 . Incredible stuff from Paul Dunne and Padraig Harrington. Baffling round by Dustin Johnson. Monday will be great.

at work still excited about Saturday's Rousey vs. Correia fight.
"hey @GaryParrishCBS, I'm sure you know and may have already spoken about it, but Rousey accepted the marine's invite!!"
Saw it late but Carlos Gomez may have passed Ryan Braun in most hated baseball players
AL 6-2 NL (B9) Ryan Braun the last batter to be used by the NL and he squeezes it up the 1st base line for a triple! Surely not...
Bryce Harper just threw out Ryan Braun at 2nd base from the track in right. Played ball off wall perfectly then used that 80 arm to get him.
Kris Bryant sneaks one just above Ryan Braun's glove into the right field basket. 16th of the year. 1-1 i the 2nd. #Cubs
"REVIEW: PHI @ MIL B1-2o: Phillies challenged (play at 1st), call on the field was overturned: Ryan Braun grounds out, shortstop Freddy ..."
"Why would it be so bad if ARod played in the All-Star Game, but nobody cares that Ryan Braun will be playing tomorrow night #MLBAllStarGame"
Bottom 9th now - Braun up - Perkins in - Ryan Braun triples down the right field line - #Brewers #BrewCrew #MLB @MLB @MlbstevenThe
K-Rod is just trying to set up Ryan Braun for a walk off grand slam in the 9th. He's all about making his teammates look good. #selfless
"Love or hate, Ryan Braun is playing some fantastic baseball as of late. @Brewers may be out of it, but it's not because of him. #justsaying"
Ryan Braun breaking with an oppo shot to right to break up the scoreless tie in the 6th. He's been impressive as of late.
"Ryan Braun making the ever so smart ""Stretch To A Triple When Down 4 Runs in the 9th"""
Ryan Braun owns right field. 23rd home run of the year. #Brewers
The Milwaukee Brewers played well today and Ryan Braun is able to hit his 24th home run and he did a fantastic job today.

@WWERollins @CFBelltown Seth Rollins great match with Neville on Monday night raw very entertaining match
A feud with John Cena may be enough to make me interested in Seth Rollins again. There has to be some irony in there.
As long as Seth Rollins leaves with his title Sunday night then I'll be happy #RAW #TitleForTitle

All you people watching Sharknado tomorrow are they terrorists hate us.
I am not in the right frame of mind to attempt to watch Sharknado 3 yet. I may need to start drinking.
I can't believe people really like Sharknado enough for them to make a 3rd part. So stupid.
"I don't even understand how Sharknado is even a thing, let alone having a 3rd movie. The SE suck, the acting sucks, and it's so dumb I laugh"
I dont understand the obsession with Sharknado.... watched the first two and they sucked. Im sure the 3rd one is just as bad.
I hate the Sharknado fandom. It's a poor imitation of so bad it's good. Also I  don't care if April lives #suckmynado
I sat through the whole of Sharknado 2 I'm pretty sure NS is nothing compared to that shit.
"I think Sharknado 3 may have jumped the shark, and gone too far down the make a bad movie road. The second half is just awful in a bad way."
Okay the first Sharknado was funny but do we really need a 4th movie? I think I lost a few brain cells after watching the 3rd
"Sharknado 3 comes on tonight. Yes, a movie about a shark tornado has made it to a 3rd movie, and yes, I too have lost all faith in humanity."
"Sharknado is the silliest film franchise so badly produced I cudnt stop laughing through the 2nd, I saw sharks flying n had to call it a day"
"The 1st Sharknado was good, the 2nd bad and the 3rd was just pathetic. They are making a 4th, but I'm done with them now! #sharknado"
Who knew there were enough people in the world easily pleased by shite like Sharknado that they're getting a 4th instalment?!
@yuu_naoyuki this is the 3rd one. Check Sharknado and Sharknado 2 too. XD it's horrible that it's hilarious. This is a really bad movie.
It may be significant to some of those who enjoy movies with a cult following but Sharknado is a disgrace to the film industry
Sharknado may well be the flat out dumbest thing ever to occupy a TV screen.
Sharknado was funny the first time. We humored them for the 2nd. But a THIRD? Even I'm not enough of a fan of bad movies to watch that shit.
#Offline Goodnight my Sharknado followers love you all back tomorrow remember #AprilLives
@planetjedward on saturday at 10pm you can watch Sharknado 3 on the german free TV channel Tele 5
Between Sharknado and this panda eating a frozen cake this has been a terribly distracting day on Twitter. https://t.co/iALjsrP9Ip
Coming up on Twitter!  Tonight: Sharknado 3 (tired jokes!) Tomorrow: Trump visits the border Friday: Cynicism Saturday: Beach pictures!
I am looking at restoring the Prophetic Ministry. It may look like a Sharknado at full throttle. @JewishTweets @TBN https://t.co/vEhJJF3gnG
I didn't watch Sharknado 3 because I never saw the 2nd movie and thought I'd be lost.
I hope Sharknado 4 starts with @mcuban saving April #AprilLives
"I just need to know if the term ""Sharknado"" will be mentioned in an AFD tomorrow. This is important."
"I know Battle of 5 Armies's script was written 1st, but they do so much in post these days.Are we sure none of it was inspired by Sharknado?"
I really hope April's robotic hand can turn into a saw for the eventual Sharknado in Orlando #Sharknado3
"I wish I was excited right now for Sharknado 3. But I'm not. I'll catch it later on today, or tomorrow on my DVR."
"In other news, lavalantuala looks like the 4th greatest movie of all time. Too bad it won't top Sharknado 1-3. #Sharknado3"
"Just finished watching Sharknado 3. It was so silly that it was decent, especially the ending. Can't believe they're making a 4th one now!"

"One day, I'll tell my kids that I was included in a CBS Local story about Sharknado tweets: https://t.co/oxyXzOTsV3"
Sharknado further proof we need the 2nd amendment.  For yoi Seneca students its the right to own a gun .
"Sharknado isn't sharknado without @TaraReid she just had a baby inside a roasted shark, c'mon people that's a dedicated mom #AprilLives"
"Why are sports news outlets tweeting about Sharknado? I mean, c'mon. Know it's the dog days, but crikes."
You mean I have wait until SHARKNADO 4 to know what happened to April?! This is bullcrap! Bullcrap I tell you! Ahhhh!!! #Sharknado3
"@Adam_Squid_Ward yo dawg, friendly reminder about Sharknado tomorrow. You still up to come?"
"@IanZiering Thank you, Ian, for making ""Sharknado"" our family's new guilty pleasure!!!  Can't wait for the 4th! #AprilLives"
@MadhuCheri tomorrow night is red carp[et premiere of Sharknado 3. Cindy has a great cameo in it.
@TaraReid  Never had a need for Twitter. Then Sharknado made the public responsible for April's life. Hope to see you in Sharknado 4.
@TaraReid I hope to see u in Sharknado 4! April just gave birth to a baby inside a freaking shark! she can survive everything! #AprilLives
@TaraReid can't wait to see what happens to April in sharknado 4 hope she lives
@YesItsColin  Always a good time with Sharknado and Twitter. Plays again Saturday at 7
"@keselowski On Hell No...great job in Sharknado. See you in Daytona in February your Body Guard from SR Perrott. Have a""Lite"" Day Brad."
@prettybaby69 Are you going to watch Lavalantula tomorrow night on SyFy? Looks pretty good. Has some big shoes to fill because of Sharknado.
A happy fun loving Saturday 2 the wonderful @TaraReid true CHAMPION of Sharknado films an always shows the love 2 everyone across the world
"Finally getting a chance to watch Sharknado 3. I liked the 1st one a lot and loved the 2nd one, so I've really been looking forward to it."
Going to get drunk and watch the badness that is Sharknado 3. This is going to be a good Sunday night.
Hanging with my Monsters on a Saturday night watching Sharknado ! They love it ! #Sharknado3 http://t.co/ckzCiTZVlZ
Happy Sharknado 3 eve. May the plot be thin and the cameos ridiculous.
"I have grown to love @TaraReid's character, April, throughout the Sharknado franchise. #Sharknado3"
I hope I can catch Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No tomorrow night idc how bad it is
I may get killed for this but I watched 15 minutes of pretty little liars. The girls acting ability is as good as the acting in Sharknado.
"I see Jimmy made it into sharknado, so wnci should be hilarious tomorrow."
Is it weird I'm excited for Sharknado 3 tomorrow night?
Make sure to watch Sharknado 3 Hell No tomorrow! @maryse0uellet is in the movie! but you'll have to find her ;)
"My kids look forward to the Sharknado movies, because they are awesomely horrible....and we need April! #AprilLives"
My mom is really lecturing me about how Sharknado is such a good movie &amp; that everyone watches it which is why they came out with a 3rd one.
"Oh you know, just making sure my schedule tomorrow allows me to watch SHARKNADO 3"
"Ok. Tonight ""Sharknado 3"", the 25th ""Lavantula"", oh you are so lucky US friends!"
Sharknado 3 tomorrow if your not excited you ain't living right
So I notice on SyFy website you can vote if April lives or dies in Sharknado 4. Essentially they announced Shaknado 4... What a great day!
Stop what you're doing. Sharknado is on syfy channel. And Sharknado 3 premieres tomorrow night. Life is good
This may be pathetic but I'm soo excited for Sharknado 3. Best to watch with lil kids tho.
Watched Sharknado tonight with mom while she recovered from surgery. Now she wants to watch 2 and 3 tomorrow. I love my mom.
You'd think with as successful a franchise as Sharknado they could splurge a little on the crappy cgi for this 3rd installment.
i am so excited to watch sharknado after work tomorrow no one even gets it
such a good ending to SHARKNADO 3!  YOU DECIDE BY TWITTER HASHTAG IF APRIL LIVES OR DIES!  the answer will be... http://t.co/9xIQwd7afq
I just found out Sharknado 3 comes out tomorrow night. I'm beyond excited
Hahahhaha depressed af. I leave the 7th. Jack and jack come on the 9th and Shawn on the 8th hahahaha kill me
"@FLshawnupdates I'm so lost lmao, has Shawn left/landed in NY already or is he leaving tomorrow morning??"

I feel bad for Camila after all..1st Ausmila for publicity (cus I don't believe that shit was real) now with Shawn.. Let the girl be in love
I just hope they don't start asking Camila questions about dating Shawn on Sunday's because it starts all this unnecessary drama
I think it's nice Shawn is trying. As annoying as it may be
"I want to see Shawn so bad tomorrow, I am so freaking depressed"
"If you used gigs &amp; tours to purchase your shawn tickets on the Monday, will you have a chance of winning a m&amp;g ticket? @o2sbe"

"Ok it's September 5th, the concert is over, Shawn liked 2 vines I was in, Ally pointed at me, I'm not at playlist live IM OVERWHELMED"
People need to stop getting so butthurt over the fact joi is getting to see Shawn in October she deserves it so much I'm gonna be happy
"Shawn is like Sun in the morning, it's bright, hot and always makes you smile."
"Shawn makes me so happy nobody understands, you may think you do, but you don't."
Shawn may be young but acts so mature and thats one of the things you should love about him
"Shawn's a smart guy, he may be young but he knows what he's talking about."
So glad Shawn has a show Wednesday night if he came to jack and jacks show I would not be on stage
Thanks very much Shawn! I hope you're having a great Monday! https://t.co/FYhZT554UJ

I like how Thor is bragging about making Esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings.

I'm not certain that the sun actually bothered rising today. We were encased in mirky twilight all day.

@BBCNews You know Go Set a Watchman is not being released until tomorrow? Really did not appreciate the spoiler on your website.

Haven't read To Kill a Mockingbird in years. That may be a good thing for when I read Go Set a Watchman. Might make it less heartbreaking.
I am looking for to the release of Go Set a Watchman tomorrow by Harper Lee . I am NOT happy with all the spoilers  telling me about  it.
"I've read the book several times, so watching ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" as a refresher before ""To Set a Watchman"" novel is released on Tuesday"
Some good tips and multi-media resources to help teach Lee's Mockingbird with Watchman. http://t.co/0BgABtAy3p #teachenglish #edchat #onted
Then you add in the guilt factor. Did Harper Lee really want Watchman published? If her 1st draft has been hijacked I'd feel bad reading it.
"Whatever thoughts and feelings Watchman is giving you, come along on July 29th to chat all things Mockingbird! It'll be a lively discussion!"

It's September 1st and this is what the White Sox are. It's sad to think about.
"Okay so the White Sox suck, Rose and Kane may be sexual predators, and Cobb and Nelson are hurt before game one. Sports suck."
"#REVIEW #RedSox @ #WhiteSox T2-1o: White Sox challenged (play at 1st), call on the field was #overturned: Travis Shaw grounds... [1/2]"
@cubsfunduh @Cubs @JArrieta34 The last run I saw was against the White Sox with two outs in the 6th... Still really good streak regardless.
@kcroyaks I do it at about half the games I go to. I'll be at the White Sox game in Chicago this Sunday so I'll do it there for sure.
@swirsk054 what do the White Sox have to focus on in the offseason? Catcher? Pitcher? 3rd base? New coach?
Adam LaRoche was a late scratch from the White Sox lineup on Monday due to right patella tendinitis.
All around bad game for the pitchers tonight 5th one in the game &amp; the White Sox are still swinging the bats #Indians #MLB #PlayoffRace
Anyone need a ticket for Sunday the 13th's White Sox game??? Potential K-Zone game. $15 if interested.
"Brutal review in the White Sox - Red Sox game. He should be safe at 3rd, but he did technically kinda sorta come off the base"
Carson Smith notched his 4th blown save after giving up two runs in the ninth against the White Sox.  This may have a bad ending. #Mariners
Eddie Rosario connected for a grand slam in the third inning of Thursday afternoon's 6-4 loss to the White Sox.
ICYMI: The M's released Fernando Rodney Saturday night after a 6-3 loss to the White Sox. http://t.co/1xLuPgYqXV http://t.co/ruz65rCA80
"Jennings, being used in higher leverage situations, in to face Mauer with Escobar on first and one out in the 7th. 6-4 White Sox"

Welp. White Sox dominating the #Royals. May be time to go back to the full strength lineup tomorrow.
"White Sox vs Red Sox tomorrow, Cubs vs Reds on the 1st, n Bears vs Packers on the 13th. What a good going away present!"
"White Sox win a challenge, Alexei Ramirez ruled safe at second upon review. Sanchez up with 0 out in the 5th."
#YakubVerdict Yakub should be hang by tomorrow any how.Then it will be great victory of our Hindustan Constitutionthe half part we have won.
@BeingSalmanKhan By religion you are Muslim and that is why you may have pain for Yakub but he was involved in the killing of 257 people..
@NaseerudinShah u supported Yakub.  Have guts to Show solidarity with #GurdaspurAttack victims ?  Remember cockroach from Wednesday?
@RajivMessage Was this media mafia behind the fact that Yakub got front page coverage when Lt respected Kalam was on 3rd or even 5th page
@TimesNow It is good news for Times Now as the terrorist may be glorified like Yakub.
@_sabanaqvi btw yakub was a good terrorist !! may he never rest in peace ..
@asadowaisi Go &amp; try your best to save him but we will make sure that bloody Yakub will be dead by July 30th !!!
@dna Yakub's guilt has been proved &amp; pardon plea rejected. Why should a sane man spk it now. Excusing pseudo-innocent may encourage criminal
@narendramodi Citizens are confused on Yakub undoubtedly he is a traitor and 2nd is he is traitor turned informer .... let RAW win.
"@tathagata2 you are right,  Yakub's mourners may be the supporters of terrorism,  they should be under scaner."
"And like all those left behind by the 257 people he helped kill, hope Yakub's daughter finds peace &amp; a better world. She turns 21 tomorrow."
Bajrangi Bhai jan I do agree with you brother should not be hanged for brother.  But Mr. Yakub is also accused...... https://t.co/vXYiDJSBaU
But it's nothing that 257 families lost their family members because of Yakub.  https://t.co/U8A37eWphV
Final decision about death should be made after the arrest of tiger memon..may be tiger forced to yakub for doing that...
Highly disappointed with @timesofindia : Yakub's last rites on 1st page news whereas Dr.Kalam who was laid to rest at ramehswaram on page 13
"I may sound cruel, be it, it's nice to have terrorists like Yakub languishing in prison, dying bit by bit, before actually being hanged..."
"It has become a wrong trend to protect the person who has been punished by SC &amp; President,without any 2nd thought Yakub be hanged#YakubDebat"
"Kurian Joseph, who raised stupid doubts about modi's good friday meet, now questions about yakub's death penalty.Some ppl never learn"
LOL Too clever by half! Your daddy was disappointed over Yakub's hanging &amp; he was a dreaded terrorist! Get it?  https://t.co/9hMx66BwmJ
"Pranab Mukherjee has just again rejected Yakub's 2nd mercy petition, hanging would be on as per schedule at 7am tomorrow #HangYakubNow ."
Salman you may be a celebrity but that doesn't mean you have the licence to say Yakub is innocent.Just stick to acting.
Still not clear whether Yakub will be hanged Thursday! One more challenge to his death sentence in the SC
"The Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon hanged.  Seculars may sign a petition to declare Yakub as a ""good terrorist"" as he died on his b'day."
Tomorrow they will discuss #YakubHanged after their Friday prayer. Bad part is 100s of youth will get inspired to be the next Yakub.
Very bad idea 2 allow the dead body of Yakub to come to Mumbai-situation may become evn more tense @Dev_Fadnavis @HMOIndia @BJPRajnathSingh
"Why Yakub is so scared of death, when he is sure of getting 72 virgins tomorrow? Why Siculars are denying Allah's guaranteed reward? Sad."
Yakub's Mercy plea has been rejected.  May you be served justice in here after.  #YakubMemon
if you are confident Yakub was innocent  why you not push tiger before 30 july ? http://t.co/fpSKB3Bsjc
Would love to watch the live screening of Yakub being hanged tomorrow... #YakubVerdict
#YakubHanged Congi liberals who are whining Kalam would have pardoned Yakub should have supported Kalam's 2nd term. Why all the drama now?
"@ANI_news In loving memory of Yakub, rahul baba will mourning with naked girls on Bangkok beach...@digvijaya_28 may join as well"
"@DeShobhaa loved the way the debate on Yakub's hanging was ended by you. ""We the people"" today was thought provoking https://t.co/cVKCmJEa8w"
"@ETNOWlive @sagarikaghose Who can tell you? so far, all gone questioning. Try talking to the Gone, may be Yakub could help !"
@India_MSM @Durga106 it sets a dangerous example...not all may be as lucky as Yakub to have an old letter to rescue.
@KanakManiDixit You are free to join Yakub tomorrow if you are feeling guilty. Don't mind I am using Freedom of Speech :)
@ZeeMohamed93 @brownbrumby the point is selective justice ha made ppl sceptical of judiciary. They may genuinely feel Yakub was innocent
@_sabanaqvi Yakub may have been sent back by ISI with Bag full of evidence with the help of some double agents in RAW
"@ndtv A Culprit should be punished not matter what the religion may be, but in Yakub's case,"
@ndtv Left parties&amp;eminent citizens' request to grant Mercy to Yakub may be rejected by President since he  faithfully follows govt advice.
@offstumped @NitiCentral Is it true that Pappu may visit Yakub's family after inspiring the FTII junkies sufficiently in Pune?
@raghumag @BhateKetan Just wanted to say all ppl with different views may not b cowards or have mercy towards Yakub.
@rai_saurabh100 @BeingSalmanKhan Yakub got bad unfair sentence due to 3rd rate prosecutor not telling court about his crucial cooperation.
"Almost all the senior people's of AAP have supported Yakub, may i know on what ground you all have done it? @ArvindKejriwal @ashutosh83B"
"As Sonia &amp; could not buy SC judgement in favor of Yakub, they are worried that Teesta and Tejpal may have to face the same fate."
"Do not think Modi is the target for Yakub drama. We may not like #AdarshLiberal lawyers like PB, but those few r smart. Ample effort 1/2"
Dont worry Congress will go on dharna tomorrow because they were talking about justice in Yakub case too.  https://t.co/j0k7X4KFLF
Hanging of Yakub proves that @BeingSalmanKhan may be a hero in reel life but in real life he is best to be ignored #YakubVerdict
"If all the 297 traitors sign an affidavit to be hung instead of Yakub, SM might recommend Yakub to be released tomorrow.  Ur time starts now"
"May I know @BeingSalmanKhan, How you can be so sure that Yakub is Innocent? Any Proof?"
Meanwhile u r fighting over useless topics Yakub's Angels has been assigned he's finished doing 16 n 17th dancing on baby doll @TimesNow
Nobody should complain that Yakub didnt get full opportunity to get Justice though it may not have gone his way.Salute to Supreme Court.
There was a strong case for giving a lifer to Yakub. But the arguments about his crucial role in the blasts may be flawed but not flimsy.
"This pic worry all ""Seculars"" too.... the way they created sympathy for Yakub, may create many more such with that..  http://t.co/thLcx5Mkwf"
"Where vanished ""candle brigade"" which used to march on every terror attack, demanding justice? Wud U march with candles to ""HANG"" Yakub?"
Yakub may not be hanged because Hindus are not united. This is the sad and bitter truth. Live with it.
Yakub will be hanged tomorrow. But his execution has exposed ugly face of our journalists. Isn't it. https://t.co/9oiYdfzu92
"Yakub's role in '93 March serial  blasts is repeated, but very little is said about those who organized 92 December, 93 January Mumbai riots"
"#PetitionPolitics The blasts may've been planned by Tiger, but it needed impeccable execution, and Yakub did a great job here, reports say.."
"At 12:00 AM - Hey Yakub, Happy birthday... May God give you a long life   *awkward silence*"

@ontariozolo @bullybers I never said ZAYN SOUNDS LIKE SHIT.. I said I thought he was 2nd best &amp; that they sound bad in that video!
Well with Zayn joining ISIS it is hard to maintain their family friendly image. https://t.co/ObzEtFCpPg
Wtf! I'm happy to see the video and all but why do you have to mention Zayn in every thing 1D does. Dafuq? https://t.co/jqnQaLoJs9
#OneDirection are breaking up following Zayn's departure. But a founder exiting shouldn't mean the end of a business http://t.co/uaTyvZDO9P
@LukeKorns then you would be so good that they would ask you to be there 5th member and you would mend there broken hearts after Zayn left
@Nadene_Sewellxx I know what you mean my bday was on the 17th Zayn left on the 25
"@NiallOfficial zayn left on the 25th, school starts on the 25th, the 25th is just not a good day"
"@honestfandom The sun is shit in general! they made up bad thing about Zayn, the baby news, Harry and 'X' girl every day, homophobic Liam"
@itvthismorning was it strange filming for the 1st time without Zayn?  #1D
@tvmblrgcrl you think she's ugly only because Zayn may be dating her.Most y'all judge them bc you want to be the one dating Zayn or whatever
@xguccilou may be they dont wanna hurt the fans with zayn's pic with the boys!
@xlotsoflouisx me too but Zayn was just on a break at 1st too so idk I'm still super scared
Auzzie is really proud of being the 2nd person to comment on zayn's nipples when that cover came out lol
Had a full conversation about Zayn leaving One Direction with my education professor in front of the whole class today. Happy Wednesday
"I find it's hilarious. Directioners use 22, I mean Taylor song and anything related with the MV to celebrate Zayn's 22nd bday."
I hope Zayn isn't hanging out with May because she's been trying to start shit with his life for years.
I hope they're not suggesting calvin and Zayn fighting because let's face it...Zayn may be tiny but he's got fast hands
"I met Harry, Liam and Niall on 26 March, the day right after Zayn announced he's leaving, the boys looked heartbroken #5monthswithoutzayn"
"I will give more solo dm with Zayn tomorrow, so stay active and turn notifs on. :) x"
I'm surprised it took this long after Zayn left for this to happen.  https://t.co/6mEm3A3ala
It was nice of @onedirection to break this news on a Sunday and not while I'm sitting at work like they did with Zayn. That was rude.
"Liams new tattoo is the number 25, do you know when Zayn left? March 25th so that must mean...  Ziam is real."
Maria thinks Harry is gonna leave the band in January and collab with Zayn on like 5 albums  and then maybe works with naughty boy same
"School starts tomorrow and I'm still sad AF about Zayn, Louis is a dad and now this tf #OneDirection"
Tbh. Drag me down music video was so good that I didn't notice Zayn was missing until the 4th time I watched it
The sun look more hurt about zerries break up than zayn and Perrie
Well...looks like One Direction has finally decided to end the standoff. Thanks for the free Zayn promo though! https://t.co/NHdmdhDpY2
"When you claim to see the sun light, but it turns out to be a flashlight. Just bc Zayn left doesn't mean they'll break up. #OhNoTheSun"
Who does Louis hate more Zayn or Harry the world may never know
"Zayn's hair is dark in the 1st and last Insta post but in the middle, his hair is silver..."
"ok, i am fixing to rant about Zayn and @Harry_Styles sorry to those that get upset.  1st, dont get me wrong, Zayn is hot af but is this +"
still not over the strange premonition of the last Q of Rolling Stone's Lost Q&amp;A w/ Zayn that they published March 25 http://t.co/JUyhRoq340
the sun is so stupid they know how much the boys mean to everyone and they knew how hard it was for us when zayn left this is so disgusting
when The Sun says 1D is gonna split yall get mad but when they said Zayn ended Zerrie with a text yall believe it ok

"@http_haz at first I was worried about their 5th album without Zayn but if they are all like that, wow."
@zaynfleek he has been happy ever since he sat next to Zayn at the Louis Vuitton fashion show (':
@zjmcartoon You started with tweeting 'who cares' and this is so stupid bc i bet when Zayn will show us his 1st song/video you will care +
"At the Chicago concert on June 2, Liam and Zayn ripped off Harry's shirt in the middle of his WMYB solo. It was a beautiful moment."
"Everybody gets happy around Zayn. People get happy, puppies get happy, the sun gets brighter, the nature gets more beautiful"
Excuse me but when did the march ended? i still rememberyself laughing when zayn left i want the old days back
Happy birthday Lima bean I love you baby Zayn loves you happy 22nd http://t.co/3pbcfT58Xr
Harry is so cute and I love them all and I love DMD but I can't help crying watching #DragMeDownMusicVideo the 1st time bc Zayn's not there.
I am still yet to see Zayn's full fledged smile with his tongue between his teeth after March :( #ZquadWantsZaynToSmile
I love how the video came out august 21st. Zayn is always making his presence known.
"I may have been mad for a day,but I'm so proud of Zayn now"
"I'm not 100% sure but if everything goes like it always does, something is gonna happen with zayn tomorrow, preferably zayn drops a single."
"I'm only excited for the VMAs because Zayn may go, if he doesn't I'll cry"
Im just so happy that Zayn is fully living his thotty dteams on this Tuesday morning. Also my hamgover is mild. #Blessed

Rumors: Zayn may will give awards on the VMA's and 1 of them could be for the the boys!  I hope it's real!
They are absolutely blind to Zayn's good nature. Use lame excuses to hate on him bc they just bitter still.  https://t.co/b7iDCP3NTi
Tomorrow at school I'm just going to think of Zayn's selfies so my day will be less terrible
"We may be an ordinary girls ,But our love to our Zayn is bigger thank you think,He saved most of us and we're thankful to him to have him."
"When DMD MV will be released tomorrow, but then you realize it's the 1st MV without ZAYN. #DragMeDownMusicVideo http://t.co/Ff5N4nQyjw"

"Zayn dedicated his 1st solo award to the boys &amp; the boys' to Zayn :"")  #5monthswithoutzayn #MTVHottest One Direction http://t.co/pZY7z9tfct"
Zayn deserves so much to be happy. I'd trade the moon for the sun if that could make him happy
Zayn is my 5th most played artist. I just wanted to clarify this b4 I'm accused of bandwagoning when he blows up
Zayn may be an asshole but he's cute and nice deep inside
Zayn may have left the band but i will still support him no matter what cs hes still the 1D zayn i love and i always will
Zayn reminds me of Rih. This may be blasphemous to say but I feel like he's about to be a male version of her which is good
"Zayn still looks ethereal, the world is still revolving, the sun still shines bright. Nobody cares :) https://t.co/Wdvp0rgUY6"
Zayn's smile is brighter than the shinning sun His eyes are brighter than the shinning stars And his personality as calm as the moonlight
Zayn: ha ha I love Philly ! Going to make appearance tomorrow .. I love pears :) x
do you ever just cry on a daily basis bc of how fat and ugly u are and the fact that u may never meet niall harry louis liam and zayn hurts
"harry today im alone at home, and tomorrow night is zayn's birthday.i want to make sure that he will notice me."
hopefully Zayn will tweet something tomorrow so I will be hydrated the crops will be watered children fed skin clear FINGERS CROSSED
im not gonna cry tomorrow i will try not to cry tomorrow bc zayn's happy now and if he's happy then im happy
