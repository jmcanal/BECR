@OnTheManney @hbryant42 I don't think Nike was ever an option. Part of it may be the small, inexperienced management team he's kept around.

@Spacekatgal @kadybat and if Nintendo came out and said "nope, we declare she is a cis woman" while that may make it "official canon"...
I just read a rumor that the Nintendo NX may not have an optical drive, and I'm just like, "are you TRYING to fail now, Nintendo?"
@jrconway3 @BitnerdGX Sure, it may not be in a direct sense. But Nintendo gives GX the support by sending them coverage and press releases.

@LewieP What a giggle. When 3rd parties were DESPERATE to work with Nintendo.
Honestly, lack of 3rd party support should have been expected. its not the company's fault for not siding with Nintendo
@ZeroSHEARER @ZhugeEX again an improvement. I don't like barely any Nintendo first party exclusives. It's ALL about 3rd party on all systems
Nintendo Chief Satoru Iwata Dies At 55
@THEREALRTU but then I suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe Nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... Lol
@16KTS @Flareonys Nintendo needs some more 3rd party reps, but at the same time that's what makes them pure.

My long shot dream announcement tomorrow from Apple: Apple TV video games include a partnership with Nintendo.
@BlazeRuler Nintendo may have wanted to make it E10+, so they left him out. I dunno, probably not true
@JediPrince84 I bought Rayman Legends just to have some simple fun. I can't wait for Nintendo to sink and become a 2nd/3rd party developer
It would be poetic if Nintendo became a Sony 2nd Party Developer. It would also make choosing consoles every generation very easy
Apparently Super Mario Maker comes out on the 11th of September. I guess it's Nintendo's way of saying "just bloody rebuild them already".
Can't believe Nintendo is finally allowing it. Wow. Pretty excited for Afterbirth too. Might actually buy it for PC. https://t.co/kGrvFkWAyJ
What if tomorrow Apple is just like, "the Apple TV is now a game console and we're going to take on Sony and Microsoft (and Nintendo)" lol.

"Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch, and this Sunday... I'm gonna make sure mine." *drops mic* DAAAAAMN Cena. #RAW
Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch, but Sunday Cena will make Rollins his.   Wow #RAW
Rollins you better win on sunday at #Summerslam! I do not want Super Cena to tie Ric Flair's 16-Time World Title reigns. #Raw #TitleForTitle
"HHH was never Ric Flair's bitch, Sunday I'm going to make you mine"
"HHH was never Ric Flair's bitch. This Sunday...I'm gonna make you mine" @JohnCena mic dropped. Promo made. @WWE

@JustinLaBar "Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch. But this Sunday in gonna make you mine." SCRIPTED. Well delivered. But scripted.
Best John Cena mic speech ever! "HHH was never Ric Flair's bitch; this Sunday I'm a make u mine!" That was badass! #TitleForTitle
You may break the record, but you're no Ric Flair, Mr Cena
Imma cry if Cena win the WWE Title this Sunday. There is no way he should tie Ric Flair's record for most world title reigns
"Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch, but this Sunday, I'm gonna make you mine!" No pressure Rollins, look at that look from HHH! #Raw
.@JohnCena Legendary  killing on mic @WWERollins "Triple H  was never Ric Flair bitchh this sunday i make you mine" #RAW #TitleForTitle #NGU
If Cena ties Ric Flair's 16th World Titles, that will truly be a slap in the face of Flair. Ridiculous #RAW
*whispers* Ric Flair is at least a seventeen time World Champion. John Cena won't tie him if he wins on Sunday.
"He may be aiming for Ric Flair, but comes off more like Billy Gunn" ~ anonymous WWE veteran in PWI about Dolph Ziggler.  Wow.

I hope Ric Flair prevents John Cena from getting his 16th title. Wwe write that into the script @TripleH @StephMcMahon
@WWE Ready to see @JohnCena  win the championship for the 16th time.  Tying the legend Ric Flair
Will John Cena tie Ric Flair tonight by winning his 16th world title? #SummerSlam
Title for Title match, winner take all, will it be Seth Rollins or will John Cena become 16th time World Champ &amp; tie Ric Flair?! #SummerSlam
Did you all know that Ric Flair was handed the belt on the 16th time? #SummerSlam
Ric Flair = Beloved Legend. John Cena = Hated by pure wrestling fans.  Even if he wins the 16th title.They won't be Equal EVER! #SummerSlam
@FezzSidd Like Ric Flair's 16th World Title everyone gets all worked up about? Nash literally handed it to him. Lost it about an hour later.
Looking forward to Monday Night Raw, I have a feeling we'll be seeing Ric Flair in the ring with Sting tonight! #WWERaw #WCW
Ric Flair says he was rooting for John Cena #WWE #RAW - Results: http://t.co/sEX52dUPuH http://t.co/I2oOUB88ta
Quick reminder to folks agreeing with Jon. Ric Flair's 16th reign came via Kevin Nash handing him the title. He lost it about an hour later.
Wait. Is what Ric Flair saying true? Did Jon Stewart costing @JohnCena the 16th @WWE Title put us in an alternate reality? #RAW

If @MsCharlotteWWE defeats Nikki Bella at #nightofchampions, it Should be similar to how Ric Flair beat Dusty Rhodes to win his 1st title
Maybe the 2nd Monster was a bad idea in hindsight. Feel more amped up than Ric Flair on speed.
The notion Nikki doesn't "deserve" to break the record is laughable. AJ wasn't Ric Flair. Hell, Nikki may be better now than AJ ever was.
22 years ago I saw Ric Flair wrestle at age 3, in the very building I'll see @MsCharlotteWWE wrestle in tomorrow night. Mindblowing!!

Rick Perry has stopped paying staff &amp; rumors of Rand Paul implosion are everywhere. Are these the 1st 2 out?

@Josh_Kimbrell   What time is the town hall meeting @ Anderson w. Rick Perry tomorrow ?
With Rick Perry's campaign unable to pay staffers, it may be time to think about bowing out or catering exclusively to a big donor.
Rest of the children's table is made of wood, except rick perry, who seems to have matured like a college student btw 1st and 2nd semesters
Looks like Rick Perry may be the first out in the #GOP race.  He's out of money already!
Is this the end for Rick Perry? If 2011 hasn't taught him anything, he may as well campaign his way out of Federal #LOCKUP !! AND #LOSE!!
Rick Perry may be the first to drop out. Out of money.  http://t.co/zwmnwXbH0J #GOP2016
I think a big part of Rick Perry's fall is simply that he is not a sitting governor this time around. May be Jeb's downfall too.
Why Rick Perry's campaign's financial woes may not mean as much in the age of SuperPACs. https://t.co/tmjA7pECUv
Rick Perry may have to drop out of the race, before one vote is cast, because he has run out of money. I have mixed feelings about that.

@LeeAdams_4Him purpose of the SCOTUS is to establish constitutionality of laws. they ruled that gay marriage bans violated 14th amend rights

@Billd111 @megynkelly @tedcruz SCOTUS has determined that the 14th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens
@SniffJenkum SCOTUS has no authority to make law. Only Congress may legislate. #SeparationOfPowers #AbuseOfPower
@cspanwj In their recent pro gay marriage decision, SCOTUS has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the United States Constitution.
Clerk #KimDavis is jailed because SCOTUS can see Gay Marriage in the 14th Amend. but Fed.Dist.Judge can't see religious freedom in the 1st.
1A: Congress can't make law preventing religious freedom, so SCOTUS interpretation unlawful Const Trumps case law https://t.co/f4LSUd5ENR
@iSupremeCourt SCOTUS would be hypocritical in re-affirming the 4th circuits ruling, but at the same time HW was kind of broad himself...
@DanThaWildMan Read the 14th amendment. Or maybe you should just read what the SCOTUS says: http://t.co/1hbUefu2l4
@topdrive496 SCOTUS says it is already in Constitution, 14th amendment.  Don't need new laws for that.
the kim davis case is just a sample of what's coming  to gun owners when SCOTUS decides it wants to redefine the 2nd amend
@Lrihendry @ChristieC733 what's scary is that it was only 5-4. Like our SCOTUS, Irving may flip on one vote.
Billy the Kid - Billy Get Your Guns https://t.co/3d02aklgud via @YouTube better get it before SCOTUS redefines the 2nd amend
@alphainparis 14th Amendment is the one used by SCOTUS in the marriage equality ruling. @gshevlin
@tedcruz our 14th amendment is also under attack, which one do we chose? oh yeah it's up to SCOTUS and they ruled!
@RushedLimbo you're literally incapable of intimidating me. anyways SCOTUS interprets the constitution. mar equality is the law of the land
Searching for marriage in the 14th Amendment; how SCOTUS usurp powers that it does not have under the Constitution. https://t.co/jFh4Hd6fYe
@angiezwick which was declared unconstitutional by SCOTUS as a violation of the 14th Amendment...so that's been settled.
@SteveThomasNow @Pontifex bottom line, it should be a Woman's Right to Privacy, as SCOTUS says, for 1st/2nd trimester only.
@JimDarcy2 @LTider @RWSurferGirl That law breaks the 14th Amendment, so it is in SCOTUS power to strike it down.
Sorry, billionaires! Might have to go all the way to SCOTUS. Pro tip: Try FULLY FUNDING your projects next time.  http://t.co/8zVJi7wBZV
@chrisbraly   SCOTUS never made law they interpreted it. 14th A guarantees equal rights for all Americans
@thebobbynelson if the SCOTUS decided that the 14th A gave a Muslim woman the right to no longer wear a head scarf, or that marriage
@John_16_2 @MrFuckBringer @LetsBe_Rational as the SCOTUS has interpreted it,the legislation in the 14th amendment protects same-sex marriage
@close_michael @danagould Disastrous? Gore was asking a State Court to violate the 12th Amendment, the SCOTUS stopped them. You disapprove?
@MisterFreedom You may want to learn about what the SCOTUS does.  @Petapup1
@StoneColdChik the panthers are advocating the killing of police, SCOTUS says that "true threats are outside the 1st Amendment so why aren't
@AlphaKruse @suz123nj @papalputz @OtterDose @MatStaver SCOTUS vitiated KY marriage law immediately b/c it violated 14th Amendment
@count_01 SCOTUS based their argument on the 14th. No matter how you stretch it race was not involved.
@ThoughtsOfTony @toddstarnes @ShaePhoenix hi Tony. As usual U pick up the story at a convenient place in time. SCOTUS imposed this on US 1st
@JAmy208 @GaetaSusan SCOTUS has interpreted equal rights under the 14th as such.
#KimDavis appealed Bunnings original order and both the 6th circuit and SCOTUS denied the appeals  Why does she think it'll change now?
@cybrpete so speaks the "soulless zombie" who fails to grasp the SCOTUS decision was based on the 14th amendment #tcot  #constitution
@LarryOConnor @GretchenCarlson U sound like the hated "smartset" now? Is #KimDavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from SCOTUS in history?
@DeepSouthProud @bryanbleano @DynaMoChen the States ensured SCOTUS could take this action by enacting 14th Amendment
Huckabee claims SCOTUS made new law on SSM. No. The equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment is more than a century old.
SCOTUS cannot make law only rule on it. Get real America.  Unless it's healthcare.Then they feel they can.    https://t.co/IyMH2Hbe09
SCOTUS Apparently is Saying That Gays Have an Equal Right to Marriage Under the 14th Amendment.
Ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman, if SCOTUS now writes law, guess Ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish.
all you gun owner better get ready B/C the next thing SCOTUS will be redefining is the 2nd amend
@Xander756 and the 14th amendment as interpreted by the SCOTUS protects gay marriage.
@Pqlyur1 SCOTUS interprets laws, and since by their interpretation it is protected by the 14th amendment it is technically a const violation
@GovMikeHuckabee WAIT WHAT?!?! SCOTUS makes laws!?!? since when? have i been lied to my entire 8th grade year about gov? (sarcasm intended)
@npallitto @TheFive ?Regardless of your position,protocol should be followed in all SCOTUS decisions.Next time it may be one you don't like
@PragmaticEbooks In 8th grade I learned that SCOTUS rulings have the force of law. They never got that far.

@PowerCat46 Read the 14th Admendment, thats were SCOTUS says the power for Gay marriage lays. In the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection

The what's a better show debate, Seinfeld vs Friends is one for the ages but you may be mentally incompetent if you think Friends is better.
Seinfeld may have not known it at the time. But he made the last sitcom that mattered.
I have work tomorrow but I'm still going to stay up and watch Seinfeld...
Let it be know that @judecomputer enjoys Seinfeld. I may have had to force her to watch episodes, but she has chosen to enjoy them.
About to see Ant Man... I don't expect it to be as good as A Bug's Life, Antz, or Seinfeld's "the Bee Movie"... But I may BEE surprised
Seinfeld may be one of the best shows of all time.

My sick day has consisted of watching Seinfeld and Facetiming and it may be the best day I've had all summer.

Impromptu day off tomorrow for an extra long weekend, so I'm treating myself to a pedicure and feeling like I'm in a Seinfeld episode.

@HarveyAraton I may be the only human being in America never watched Seinfeld once, ditto, Friends, all those sitcoms. Only TV for sports.
Friends and Seinfeld (I didn't get cable until 3rd grade so I watched the shows on satellite) https://t.co/FsOjafAt8B
Keith Hernandez on Seinfeld was the best appearance by an athlete on any TV show or movie. 2nd is Mark McGuire on Mad About You.
Plus I got Seinfeld all on DVD Plus I killed the math section on the SAT
I told someone about how I once sat on the floor of my hotel room and watched Seinfeld for hours and they threatened to punch me.
@jellybean1398 watching the last episode 1st is why I skipped watching Seinfeld for MANY yrs. The 1st few yrs at least of Mad Men were good.

Awesome day in Central Park. Looking forward to Seinfeld tour and then NXT Takeover Brooklyn tomorrow  #NXTTakeOverBrooklyn #NXTBrooklyn
To quote Seinfeld's Kramer, Monday has a feel; Wed has a feel, and FRIDAY has a feel. Here's to feeling the first Friday of the school year!
kramer is the best character on Seinfeld. George close second, Newman 3rd.
Popcorn and Seinfeld sounds like the perfect friday night... #ithinkimgettingold
Someone needs to make a Video Compilation of all the SAT vocabulary Cosmo Kramer spontaneously uses on Seinfeld
@ChrisDuel sometimes I forget you're 80 years old. Reading the Sunday paper at 5am...you missed the early bird, Seinfeld
I'm on the floor eating left over spaghetti for breakfast and watching Seinfeld while the baby naps. Must be Monday #maternityleave
Will watch old movies, Seinfeld and other silly things till Sunday...the old #katrina news footage is too much for this heart to bear.

World, I think it may be time to accept that nothing Larry David did after Seinfeld has been funny.
I'm finding my life and the dialogue around me are right out of a Seinfeld episode. Many of you may think this is fun, but it's unnerving.
Stuck in the lodge with Jim the dads army loving sound guy who claims Seinfeld and Friends are the worst shows of all time. I may knife him.
@starbex Or something like NBC's "Blackout Thursday" where they had the lights come back on at 9pm because Seinfeld refused to participate.
Won't be live tweeting the vma's tonight despite what you may have guessed. Watching Seinfeld instead. Thank you.

@Seinfeld2000 something has been bugging me lately. What if Seinfeld was current day? What if brand new episodes came out every Thursday?
Interested to see what kind of ratings the U.S. Open final gets on Saturday with Serena presumably going for history up against CFB.
I'm pretty sure Serena ripped that match winning ace the same time USMNT game up their 3rd.
And with Serena's 11th ace she wins the match vs her sister Venus
History still in the making with Serena's win over sister Venus! #GrandSlam https://t.co/p56xxav8vv
@bgtennisnation Serena can't fool me that 2nd set was a gift to Venus. She didn't want to beat her in 2 easy sets.
I love my Nike players!! Way to go Serena! Expecting great things from you tomorrow, federer!
Serena just needs to win two more matches to win the last 5 majors/4 in a single year/last 4 us opens https://t.co/dwz4tM0HBN
Serena reaches her 7th semifinals of the #USOpen in a row. Two more matches to complete the Grand Slam.
@hbryant42 Venus missed so many neutral shots in 3rd set that she never let Serena feel the pressure; she let her off the hook, in a way.
One of the most beautiful moments in tennis history! Nice hug! Serena defeats Venus in their 27th face-to-face... http://t.co/GPtPn3SWvO
Serena won, but big sister Venus gave her the flux! Congrats to both of them for giving us a great tennis match. https://t.co/brJ29dzm2X

Happy for Serena. I want her to win the 22nd GS, tie Steffi and win the CYGS. @usopen #usopen
I hope every young girl watched the Williams sisters tonight. Serena may have won but they'll go down as the greatest sibling duo ever!
Serena is emotionally drained. Hope she has time to rest up before Thursday.

Serena be lettin oponents comeback in the 2nd set just to make the media feel better. That good #SerenaVsVenus

Serena may have taken that match, but Venus wins.  So much class.  Just a good person. The same cannot be said about her sister.  #veealways
@MauriceBear21 she may beat Steffi or Serena's Open Era Record of titles, who knows at this point.
@AlexSanderNYC How can you give people tips to better their lives when u just sat on here slandering Serena over her body? #GetAGripSir

Couldn't hang on to stay up and watch 3rd set but it was nice to see Serena beat Venus. What a resilient, tough player Venus is, tho.
