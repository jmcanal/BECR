@nevona @BernieSanders I love Bernie Sanders, it's great you're spending your Saturday for his campaign.
the only thing that i am afraid of if bernie sanders is president he may die in office
I told my dad I may vote for Bernie Sanders this election &amp; he's literally giving me the silent treatment LOL HEADASS #butthurtaf
Bernie Sanders is like your 8th grade class president who won the election by campaigning to have 3 hour recess and free cookies every day
@gop_reaper @ginou1010 Now, now, some of them are coming over to support Bernie Sanders, because he makes sense, but then they may agree?
Bernie Sanders joined a picket line in the sun &amp; after gave a 3hr speech. I'm significantly younger &amp; exhausted from putting groceries away.
Even Bernie Sanders thinks Cal football isn't getting enough hype. There's no reason they can't start 5-0 and finish 2nd in the Pac-12 North
If Bernie Sanders gets elected he'll create 2nd depression by high taxes, outsource jobs,small businesses collapsing https://t.co/smtMptt8h6
Bernie Sanders may be extreme, but he honestly seems to despise poverty, racism, discrimination, war, income inequality, &amp; corrupt politics.
@DanielWitDaPolo well you may have noticed that Bernie Sanders doesn't slander other politicians. He's never ran a negative campaign. :)
What about the other candidates?  All have a chance.  *smiling*  Bernie Sanders may upset them all.
It's bernie sanders' birthday on the 8th im excited I love him
