I just cut a 25 second audio clip of Aaron Rodgers talking about Jordy Nelson's grandma's pies. Happy Thursday.	
Tough loss for the Dolphins last Sunday in Miami against Aaron Rodgers &amp; the Green Bay Packers: 27-24.

"@Espngreeny I'm a Fins fan, it's Friday, and Aaron Rodgers is still giving me nightmares 5 days later. I wished it was a blowout."	
When girls become bandwagon fans of the Packers because of Harry.   Do y'all even know who Aaron Rodgers is?  Or what a 1st down is?	
Aaron Rodgers is really catching shit for the fake spike Sunday night.. Wtf. It worked like magic. People just wanna complain about the L.	
If you think  the Browns should or will trade Manziel you're an idiot. Aaron Rodgers sat behind Favre for multiple years.

@This_JustIn31 Aaron Samuels asked Cady Heron in math class what day it was. And Cady responded with October 3rd :D	
@ijustine @cescadarling @heyingridnilsen it's October third. the day that Aaron Samuels talked to Cady. we still need a viewing party.	
"i feel really compelled to write some oct 3rd fanfic where Aaron Samuels' dies on oct 3rd and his last words are ""What day is it?"""	
If I was Cadi and Aaron Samuels asked me what day it is I would probably say October 29th or something because I never know what day it is.	
"My edition of Cady's and Aaron Samuels' encounter: On October 8th, he asked me if he was doing the lab correctly. I said no."	
@amyrobJAFEEL just informed me that Aaron Samuels is gay in real life...dreams ruined. October 3rd ruined.	
I forgot to post last October 3rd for the commemoration of Aaron Samuels asking Cady Heron the date that day! #MeanGirlsQuotes #MeanGirls	
I had a dream Aaron Samuels wasn't happy it was October 3rd.....	
"fun fact: Jonathan Bennett, (Aaron Samuels, Mean Girls) is gay.   lol it isn't october third any more, ladies  #meangirls #Oct3rd"	
It's October 3rd. Ten years since Mean Girls. Aaron Samuels can still get it.	
The only thing that could be better than Aaron Samuels doing the jingle bell rock dance on Dancing with the Stars is if it was on October 3	
Also since I'm watching Aaron Samuels on dancing w/ the stars I'm just disappointed that I didn't give October 3rd proper justice #MeanGirls	
Aaron Samuels in the house... Wearing pink and it ain't even Wednesday! #MeanGirls #DWTS	
"It's October 4th. Let's be real, Aaron Samuels probably asked her the date then too. That guy was a tool. #MeanGirls"

@Flash_Joey I had Asiata playing Thursday so had to make a decision then.	
"@uSTADIUM Tried to pick up Sanu, but I'm 8th on the list, so I didn't get him. But, I dropped Asiata for McKinnon."	
Vikings=10th ranked run game VS Lions=4th ranked run defense.  Need the O-line and Asiata and McKinnon to shine.	
@Roto_Dubs My only Bradshaw concern is it's Thurs game-only 4 day rest-scared of injury.Would you drop Asiata for someone on waiver?	
#SuperKamiFantasyGuru not likin this Zimmer u just SAID that Asiata was DEMOTED after Sun. GAME MAKE UP UR DAMN MIND http://t.co/p5OgO4W2DL	
Should have stuck with my gut &amp; sat Asiata. Thus concludes my weekly tweet about Matthew Asiata.	
"@TheDFRankings @FFOP_EMT_Pous Mostly its the Patterson issue, Asiata is useless aside from a being decent 3rd down &amp; goal line RB."	
"@Fanta_c_Freak I want to start Forsett and Mckin but I may start Vereen  instead of Mckin, Asiata is still getting work (unfortunately)"	
@SiriusXMFantasy I sat gates. But I have Olsen instead. Shoulda started both of them instead of Asiata in the flex.	
"@TheMattCamp appreciate it!  One more for you if I may; need to SIT 1: Garcon, Alfy, Asiata, Stacy"	
"3rd and 2.  RUN IT WITH ASIATA!  Oh well, just another interception."	
"@MikeClayNFL just got Bradshaw &amp; a 3rd for Asiata, Robert Woods &amp; a 4th in Dynasty. Thoughts? Was using Ivory &amp; Asiata to start w Murray."	
"@4for4_John Got Asiata @ start of WK2, let him get two good games and sent him in a trade for a '15 2nd, same guy just offrd him bk for 3rd"	
@DrewAngelozzi88 @ESPNFantasy Asiata may have a tough time against Det run D but I'd still lean him if I was playing it safe.	
Game plan for the 2nd half. Don't pass it to Asiata.	
Teddy Bridgewater with his 2nd INT of the day. This one on Asiata though. Gotta make the catch.	
@SAF4SAFF Landry and Roberts are out there too. Would you cut Asiata for a 2nd WR for FLEX or just start JHill Cin? Also down Jennings.

@br_football @TimDCollins could say Moya did the same thing with worrying comment that Atleti's place is 3rd or 4th. I was displeased indeed	
"@RahulxC Well, choices wise may be it makes sense recognizing his form. But I'm just saying Atleti's system has a lot of say in it."	
"Might see if Atleti can claw their way back into this game in 2nd half, but you get the feeling Siquiera needed to score that penalty"	
@TerryGibson88 @revistadelaliga @DriscollFC Valencia passed their 1st big test of the season against Atleti. Based on that can you see them	
Diego Alves might've won the game for Valencia by saving Siqueira's penalty. It would've made a big positive impact for Atleti in 2nd half.

#Lions march down the field and #Vikings fans can't blame Christian Ponder on that. That's not a good sign after coming off 10-day break.	
QB Christian Ponder was taken with the 12th pick in the #2011Draft. Picked before QB's Andy Dalton &amp; Colin Kaepernick http://t.co/cwLo9kO7f6	
Christian Ponder may not be a great qb but he is a great individual. Shout out to him for his act of kindness.	
"You may not like his football, but Christian ponder just did something really cool #lululemon"	
"Yeah, Christian Ponder may be a great guy, but he is a complete dumpster fire behind center."	
Sam Ponder is the hottest reporter ever. Christian Ponder may suck at QB but he gets to go home to that so he still wins.	
"Teddy Bridgewater is the 3rd most shown QB during games, but my guess is this largely influenced by the TNF horror with Christian Ponder."	
@TomFornelli @InTheBleachers @McShay13 I'd prob say 3rd or 4th. All it takes is 1 team to fall in love tho. See EJ Manuel &amp; Christian Ponder	
Christian Ponder may not be a good QB but after reading this it's hard to hate him. #FirstClass http://t.co/IDOUMEjyX2	
Christian Ponder may be a back up and never amount to much in the NFL but man can he feel great waking up next to Sam Ponder #gorgeous	
Christian Ponder would be proud of that 1st quarter passing outburst for the #Vikings

@tateaona loved subtweeting ur tweets about how ugly Katy perry was in 9th grade	
Need some 7th inning magic if we hit Kershaw twice in the 7th inning to win games we can do it to anybody	
The @Cardinals bullpen's impression of 7th inning Kershaw was spot on tonight	
"@TylerPoslosky Kershaw was mowing them down in the sixth in Game 4, and got shelled in the 7th. Have to be able to count on your bullpen."	
@Cardinals were down 6-2 to Kershaw heading into the 7th of the NLDS Game 1. This one isn't over #STLCards fans. #NLCS	
"@BeisbolsOrg U may be right in the end, but it takes 4 wins to wrap up a 7-game series. If Cards can rough up Kershaw twice, Bum can be too."	
"@vivaelbirdos but it seems difference is Waino getting stronger, Kershaw was the same till the 6th. That's all I gots."	
Cardinals bullpen just did their best 7th inning Kershaw impression.	
"@KirtK2 agreed. I mean, we got to Kershaw, twice. We can still do this. We can win tomorrow. We CAN win the NLCS, I just don't thin we will."	
"Oh.. I'm sorry, Matt Adams took MadBum deep in the 4th to make it 3-2 Cards? Please tell me again he's better than Kershaw. #dafuckouttahere"	
@mvttyyp Ya never would have thought you'd lose 2 games when kershaw had leads going into the 7th	
@drew_whipple I'm glad it's not my call! He looked amazing. So did Kershaw in the 6th of game 1.	
"Matt Adams ties it up - 1st HR Bumgarner has allowed this post-season. Adams can't hit lefties, but he's taken MadBum &amp; Kershaw deep. #NLCS"	
"All of a sudden nobody's talking about June, nobody's talking about the Dodgers, about Kershaw, McCutchen, Bryce Harper, or Wainwright. :)"	
"we've beaten Kershaw, so why can't we beat MadBum tmrw? we win tomorrow, then just gotta win both at home. #havefaith #CardinalNation"	
"Tough loss, needed to get the series tied before Bumgarner tomorrow. Oh well, we beat Kershaw twice and we weren't supposed to do that..."	
@Eize33 I completely agree. It sucks how it worked out but flash back to the 7th innings vs Kershaw when you over use a pitcher.	
Cardinals Wainwright tried to mimic Kershaw's mechanics. Realized that after he tried dragging out his delivery leg kick. In wain of the 7th	
Apparently the #STLCards had &amp; missed their chance in the 1st and Bumgarner's back in Koufax mode now. Wish he'd go Kershaw mode. #NLCS #fb	
@erinscafe The 6th inning felt like the tipping point for the series. Cards can hit Kershaw but not Bumgardner.	
I bought Kesha's debut album for $7 in 9th grade and thought I would regret it. Now I'm almost 20 and still inappropriately dancing to it.

SPX rallying on #sfgiants going up 3-0 in 1st inning

"We've got some stories about that. Coach Stoops has a history of being #TooTurnt Swindle told him Sat. ""You got too much juice."""	
"@jasonkersey If he was Derrick Strait or Roy Williams, he might get a pass. He may yet get there but for now, he's closer to Stoops doghouse"	
"Stoops said he was in contact with the league about J.D. Harmon hit, leading to suspension Saturday."	
"Stoops said Towles did some good things Saturday, took care of the ball better than the previous weeks."	
"Really Stoops, run the ball on 3rd and 21? Overpaid and under produce,"	
"@SteveMaricle you guys are really putting Stoops in an awkward place... I mean, Heupel was his 1st quarterback. They have 14 yrs of history"	
Stoops says one of his players will miss 1st half vs LSU - self imposed penalty for what he calls selfishness on the field. No name given	
"@KirkHerbstreit What's ur take on job Stoops is doing @ UK? 2-10 to 5-1, a missed call away from 6-0 and sole possession of 1st in the East"	
Announcer said Mine Stoops chagrined at 3rd down issues? How about pissed? OU dodged another one on Texas bad snap.	
"What was the running bet? I would get A tramp stamp of Stoops face if we won Saturday??? Yall would each give me a grand if we lost.,."	
I think the 2nd quarter passing will loosen things up for the run in second half. Stoops gets conservative with the lead  @THEDIRTMCGIRT	
Kentucky's Stoops is wary of the Tigers' big-play potential. LSU is 12th in nation in plays of 20 yards or more: http://t.co/XvY5KIZRBp	
"When they said Stoops has been ""chagrined by 3rd down problems"" it sounded like they meant OU having problems."	
Stoops says he appreciates UK allowing football program to host a Thursday night game next season against Auburn.	
The fact that CBS is doing their SEC game of the week in Lexington on the 25th speaks volumes about what Stoops has done at UK #BBN	
"When they said Stoops has been ""chagrined by 3rd down problems"" it sounded like they mean OU having problems."	
"Stoops said he's going to suspend a player for the first half of Saturday's game. Someone asks if he wants to say who. Stoops: ""Not really."""	
"On Thursday night game helping recruiting, Stoops said: ""I think it helps."""	
"Stoops admits he wouldn't believe they'd be 2nd in the country in interceptions. ""I gotta be honest there."""	
Stoops got the record 10th win against saxet!

@Nita_Reid I haven't been able to watch TVD live these days due to Football. Every Thurs there is high school FB going on at 8pm. Like WTF!	
TVD is barely on it's 3rd episode of the season and the story is already super damn goooood

#BMF1USA Vettel announces that he will use his 6th full engine in Austin and he won't take part in qualy beacause he will start from pitlane	
Vettel will use 6th engine in Austin. He already announced not to take part in qualifying cause he will start from pitlane anyway.	
@McLaren_Soul I really don't see what you see in Vettel... Care to share. The guy may be 4 time WDC but he's not that great	
@F1sasha can Seb Vettel's 6th engine/power unit be different to the first 5 in any way? @BallzRadio @ForzaJules	
"What if this whole Vettel and Alonso thing is just an ""April"" fools joke?"	
"Horner has revealed that the engine Vettel used last time out in Sochi, where he finished 8th, will soon need to be changed. #F1"	
"On Oct 29th, Vettel will drive the Infiniti Q50 Eau Rouge up &amp; down Congress Avenue in downtown Austin https://t.co/ylwsZCqEus via @EmBuxton"	
"As he won't be taking part in the #USAGP qualifying, Vettel asked: Do you have any suggestions on how I could spend my Saturday in Austin?"	
Vettel will get a 6th engine in Austin and told that he'll not take part in qualifying because he will start from pit lane #F1	
Vettel: Have you perhaps a few suggestions on how I could spend Saturday afternoon in Austin ? #F1 #AustinGP

"@JoeyLemons Ha, I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I'm just happy it's not Vettel's 5th consecutive championship #easilypleased"	
@F1grid he will stay at Ferrari and drive the 3rd car with Raikkonen and Vettel as teammates	
"@redbull boss confirming that Vettel will be released on the 28th November, thus missing the two-day test on November 25th and 26th."	
it is funny watching Vettel getting treated like a 2nd class citizen: Red Bull Webber mode!	
Vettel makes 6th engine change so will sit out qualy as he must start from pit row. Calls the rules stupid. I'm not sure he's wrong. #F1

@NuladThePundit in Europe country comes 1st b4 club. Incase in missed it Welbeck is on 7goals in all competition.	
"Nice to see Welbeck training well in the photo , hopefully he will bag a goal or two tomorrow against Hull ! #AFCvHCFC"	
Can't wait to see my best friend! he comes back from Welbeck tomorrow! he is like a brother to me! #Reunited #friendshipgoals #bruh	
@cridheone he was honest with Welbeck he was our 4th choice striker neither one to blame its good for all he left	
Really hope Welbeck is fit for Saturday and it's just a little knock	
@MoodieNathan Yeah dont think 8 or 9 like some.. Is a risk but Welbeck must be amongst the goals! As for Delph got a knock rested for Sunday	
"A Good night for the @Arsenal boys tonight! Welbeck scored, Chamberlain played well and Chambers made his 1st start! #Arsenal #EnglishCore"	
"Nice to Welbeck score his 8th goal in 10 games, the thinking play of Lallana &amp;  Oxlade Chamberlain bringing some proper skill onto the pitch"	
"@dafunzee he may start from bench, it depends on the severity of Welbeck's knock."	
@DezilDez we may be seeing it more with him and Welbeck together.	
"Another local Derby saturday, We travel the short trip to Welbeck for a 3 pm kick off   #Uptheceltic"	
"Arsenal's Danny Welbeck was awful in the 1st half, but it was great to see Welbeck, ex #mufc legend, on the scoresheet in the 2nd half."	
"What a difference not having Sterling on the pitch makes! Welbeck dragged wide 1st half, the Ox replaces Sterling, Welbeck down middle, goal"	
Still can't believe it.. Bloody linesman. On the plus side I had Welbeck at 3rd goal scorer	
"Just twisted his ankle but he is ok ""@seru25: Welbeck may hv picked up one. What is happening to our team?"""	
"Hull on Saturday right. OX, Cazorla, Alexis behind Welbeck for me. Rest picks it's self."

"@dotski_w first Labour lead with YouGov since last Wednesday, looks like the Tory conference bounce is over though"	
"@LouiseBaldock great work; you may or may not have noticed: even deeply biased YouGov's poll tonight has lab 5% lead.  We r strong, united."	
Birmingham bounce: YouGov on Fri and Sun and now @LordAshcroft today all put the Tories ahead http://t.co/iz7Trb9X5k http://t.co/5ZLHrXsJhC	
"YouGov tonight  shows 2% Labour lead. So headlines tomorrow -""Crisis for Cameron as Labour pulls ahead"" Or perhaps not."	
The fantasy world of YouGov and their weightings.  Check the raw (unweighted) figures. http://t.co/tc70YJocx8	
Tonight's YouGov poll is the first since last Wednesday to show a Labour lead.	
"@Mowman123 i think YouGov needs to be treated with caution after their rougue indyref poll&amp;Labour were 5,5,5&amp;7 ahead upto Thursday&amp;then an"	
@KEdge23 @DavidJames901 @Sun_Politics Looks like it might be left until 6am tomorrow morning on YouGov site.	
IF tonight's YouGov shows another Tory lead then Ed Miliband is in big trouble #SaveEd Would be 4th poll in last few days with a Tory lead	
"Total silence on YouGov's 10pm poll for The Sun tonight. Of course, this has no bearing whatsoever on what it might reveal."	
YouGov poll for Sun finds that 41% would vote to remain in the EU while 40% would vote to leave that would settle everything...	
LAB lead down to 1% in latest YouGov poll for the Sun  CON 33% LAB 34% LD  7% UKIP 14%. Will they hold H&amp;M by-election? @Labour in crisis?	
The Sun political editor says the combined % of CON &amp; LAB will be at all time low for this parliament when YOUGOV polling figures released	
Huge difference in tomorrow's Survation and YouGov polls in the papers. It's almost like they mean absolutely fuck all.	
"According to YouGov, UKIP are 2nd-most popular party in the C2DE social grade bracket http://t.co/dIajR2xRwN (Lab 36%, UKIP 25%, Con 24%)"	
"Tonight's YouGov: Lab 35, Con 30, UKIP 15, LibDem 9, Green 5. &gt;not one for the Sun's front page or a Nick Robinson analysis I think"

I forgot how sad the first episode of the 5th season of Dexter is. #depressing #dexter #darkpassenger
Oct. 2 is almost too far away for me to wait for the return of #Dexter!
"(OFF TOPIC) - there is only 3 episodes on the first disk of #Dexter. Please hurry, @netflix with the 2nd #fitblog"
"@iheardavoicesay is finally catching up to me with #Dexter. I'm only up to season 4, but he has almost finished season 2 today @ home, ill."
"I downloaded the first season of #Dexter, gonna start watching the 2nd episode. Time to tweet #twittwit ^^"
Let's see if I can wrap up season three of #Dexter tonight: only 1 more episode to go till the season finale. Roll on series four please!
RT @ReignOfSuccess: 1st rule of the code: Don't get caught  #Dexter
"#3words \""""Tonight's the night\"""" #dexter @SHO_Dexter"
"#ICanHonestlySay #Dexter is such a good show, I may order Showtime just because of it."
@dazzlindez @hotspur18 Don't feel obliged to discuss #Dexter tonight. Living it large in Brighton so please use direct messages....
"@hughhefner Make sure you & the girls watch seasons 1-5 of #Dexter, before season 6 premieres Oct 2.  Seasons 1 & 4 are the best!"
Addicted to #Dexter... what's new. Almost done with season 5 and I just got it on Thursday!
Barely going to sleep after watching #dexter all evening! I love this show!
"Beer and chicken night! Watching #Dexter till the working hours (11.59pm - 8 am) Maybe we should reserve the nickname \""""dexter\""""? Might be fun"
Enjoying a night of #Dexter with @DomoniqueP07 :)
"Finally starting the 5th season of #Dexter.  See ya later, weekend!"

@roslyngjones I\u2019m going Tuesday to the house of blues to see A$AP Rocky
I have a real dilemma here\u002c so tomorrow is the A$AP Rocky concert in phoenix but I got called back to start working tomorrow at Bianchi\u2019s
Whoever\u2019s going to A$AP Rocky wit me on the 8th better buy their tickets like today. I think imma get mine soon
"\""""@Rican_Amor: Who wants to go to a A$AP Rocky concert with me on the 14th or 15th ?!?!?\"""" you don\u2019t have a choice on who you taking we going!"
@KalebZian I see you\u2019re in Dallas & a fan of A$AP Rocky\u002c email us (att@m80.com) for a great oppo to attend show at HOB on Fri!
@funfunfunfest is coming up this weekend!! We\u2019re super excited! Playing the Blue Stage on Sat night right before A$AP Rocky!
AHHH! My mom said yes for me to go the A$AP Rocky concert!! Nov 8th we out! #EXCITED
It looks like my brother is going to see A$AP Rocky tomorrow sigh his life needs to stop being significantly better than mine
May I ask what\u2019s so cool about A$ap Rocky?
Oooh yha and the DMC and A$AP ROCKY one is 2-4th
Merril Hoge is stupid. I'm sick of hearing what Tebow can't do. He may not be a #1 right now but it took Aaron Rodgers 3 yrs to start
RT @MNVikingsGuy: Is it possible for Aaron Rodgers to suffer a career ending injury tonight? Just curious.
"Aaron Rodgers jersey battery room, under the windmill. Wagnoli - 4 August 2011 - Blog - designer wedding dresses sale,"
"And on the very first play of the night, Aaron Rodgers is INT'd by UDFA CB Brandian Ross, who returns it for a pick-six touchdown."
Da way aaron rodgers lookin greenbay may take it again
"RT @Jim_Alexander: For those just tuning in, #Chargers have linked those two games as pkg. To see Aaron Rodgers Nov 6, you gotta buy tix ..."
"finished qbs. if the draft were today and i got to pick first every time, i'd take Arian Foster, Roddy White, Jason Witten, n Aaron Rodgers"
@olbagofdonuts Sensationalism at its finest. Next thing you know we'll be hearing that Graham Harrell may take Aaron Rodgers' spot. SMH.
Aaron Rodgers may be the best QB in the NFL and he is still improving -yahoo sports! Nigga fuck with my teamm
"Aaron Rodgers totally did the A.I. \""""practice?\"""" routine for the media today. It must be good to be a champion #Packers"
"All you need is Ryan Leaf and you got a show. RT @jimrome: Aaron Rodgers, Kurt Warner and Kyle Kendrick are all in The Jungle tomorrow."
Browns force Aaron Rodgers and the Packers to go 3&Out on 1st possession. Browns are better than the Steelers at one thing at least.
I saw a photo of Aaron Rodgers with some awesome scruff going on today. Did I mention he was at the White House today? IZ COOL.
"So far I have drafted Aaron Rodgers at #9 overall, and then at #16 in the 2nd round, Matt Forte. Not bad."
"The score may have been 38-26, but Aaron Rodgers kept right up statistically with Favre. Damn. #skolvikings"
today is the day we have been waiting for all summer: the day we see aaron rodgers on the field again. so excited. #packers

I just realized that the boys won their Brit Award on my birthday February 21 then I was like partying that time they recieved it!#BESTGIFTx
Look how far they\u2019ve come since July 23rd 2010. They have a smash album\u002c Brit Award\u002c and the even beat out Justin Bieber for a TCA.

@NJHoranHugs Haha\u002c I hardly knew about them and one day I was at her house and she sat me down and made me watch the Brit Awards with her :)
It makes me feel so gay that I just set the classical Brit awards to record tomorrow haha oh dear
So glad that the Classical Brit Awards are on ITV 1 on Sunday have set the record button just in case I forget to watch.
this nigga @OctobersOwn91 just hit a full court one handed shot with brook lopez...smh\u002c 21st birthday shit
@Chris_Cordaro24 1st game in brooklyn and i want to see brook lopez
Brook Lopez gets a short shot +1\u002c #brooklynnets lead 71-56 w/ 4:20 to play in the 3rd quarter. #hellobrooklyn
Brook Lopez scored 9 points in the 2nd quarter and was featured by #Nets. Joe Johnson was absent\u002c but should play in 2nd half. #Nets #NBA
Brook Lopez with a Double Double in the 3rd #NetsNation
Dont look now but: Brook Lopez had 19 pts & 9 rebs (28mins) in 1st game back from foot injury over weekend. 18 & 11 (25 mins) tonight.
Imma need Brook Lopez to get more aggressive on the boards. 7 feet tall\u002c c\u2019mon son
@realcavsfans @GregBag79 AV has 11 offensive rebounds with 4 minutes left in the 3rd. That\u2019s a good month for Brook Lopez.
Brook Lopez the 2nd best offensive center in the NBA he not ass
son if deandre learned anything more than dunking.he could be the 3rd best center in the league. brook lopez\u2019s rebound numbers hold him back
@mperillo86 watching Cannavaro on the 2nd even more embarrassing.
Although there was that one time he finished 3rd and Cannavaro finished 1st. Yes\u002c Fabio Cannavaro. Bullshit.
But this is not the 1st time that Juventus is maximizing the potentials of ex-Milan players..Cannavaro and Edgar Davids are similar cases
@Raheem_orDie tomorrow fc toronto vs liverpool? Are you go at stadium? Today napoli won 3 a 2 vs bayern !! Scored: Pandev\u002cCannavaro\u002cinsigne!
@zachbussey that year is to be unspoken of. Remember those rubber bracelets too? I may or may not have a dog tag with Cannavaro on it....
Drogba(as reports suggest he is preferred to start)\u002c If Cannavaro has anything close to the game he had on friday then he takes this.
This is Buffon\u2019s 122nd cap for Italy\u002c now just 4 behind Maldini in 2nd and 14 behind the leader\u002c Cannavaro. #Legend
"\""""For the 1st time since 1978 Italy will travel to a major tournament without Franco Baresi\u002c Paolo Maldini or Cannavaro\"""" via @zonalmarking"
@Colliinnn and he hasn\u2019t lost a match since Apr 2nd last year\u002c that\u2019s consistent\u002c and never forgetting Cannavaro\u002c the 1st defender to win it
@Daniel_Dennehy Just saw u with Cannavaro\u002c didn\u2019t know u were here in Italy! Congratz for being the 2nd best in the world!!! #Legend
@EgyptianLover_ @Tyga 3rd??! :O where have I been I thought Careless World was the 1st one. No?

Have had two very enjoyable nights of Carling Cup action with Arsenal last night and CFC this. Will QPR v Reading on Sunday live up to it..?
The BBC are asking if last night\u2019s Carling Cup 4th round tie between Reading and Arsenal was the greatest cup tie of all time. Honestly.
@GregUnittXIV I hate to say it but I think it\u2019ll go to penalties tomorrow. I just have that feeling\u002c like I had before the Carling Cup Final
@DunkinBoston Because I went to my 1st match when I was 4? My last match was the Carling Cup Final. #DDLiverpool   http://t.co/IGhqM4Vo

@HTTR24_7 If Cundiff is still the kicker come Sunday I\u2019m starting a riot.
WVU goes for it on every 4th down. Is our kicker worst than Cundiff?
"#Nationals 9th Inning had that \""""4th Quarter #Redskins\"""" feel\u002c didn\u2019t it?  Coulda swore I saw Cundiff shank one from the mound."
"@SuperSkin\""""Van full of veteran kickers due into #Redskins Park tomorrow. No word on whether it will run over Cundiff.\"""" Watch it go wide Rt."
Cundiff got released. I think he\u2019s outta the league now\u002c especially if that quote on the TL this past Sunday was real
Dirty Jim had to close that one out. If not\u002c he may have started hearing comparisons to Cundiff in this town.
If Cundiff would\u2019ve made the Field Goal Sunday\u002c I could\u2019ve been eatin\u2019 a free 6in sub at Subway for lunch!
@AustinDB34 I know thats what Im saying lol Tucker straight outkicked Cundiff in camp\u002c I\u2019m glad he\u2019s gone. Didnt he miss one in the 4th qtr?
Rg is cleared for the Vikings game Sunday #goodmood   p.s. thank God we got rid of Cuntsniff or is it Cundiff?

Aw what the hell Curtis Painter coming in and we give up 3rd and 18 conversion.
Curtis Painter's finally going to get a shot tonight.  I can't help but root for that guy!
Curtis painter did the curtis Painter last night... a fumble and one walk-in td overthrown by 8 yards.
Lmao RT @HeatherNoel13: Curtis painter looks like the kind of guy who would try to buy beer on Sunday. #scumbag

Curtis Painter was asked in interviews today if as the lead singer of Nirvana was getting the band back together.
I've got a blog post coming up tomorrow. Topic? It's time to learn once and for all what Curtis Painter's got. Start the man. #Colts
"In 14 minutes of Kerry Collins, the #Colts are down 17. Let's give Curtis Painter a shot in the 2nd quarter. Why not?"
"It's going to be a somber set tonight for Curtis Painter's Nickelback cover band, Something In Your Mouth."
Curtis Painter...we have a chance again! Can't believe Kerry Collins didn't throw us a pick-six tonight
It looks like the Curtis Painter era of Colts may begin tonight!
Kerry Collins may look like an old mouse... and hold on to the ball like one... but is a Curtis Painter experiment REALLY that much better?
"RT @PeterBurnsRadio: Curtis Painter is totally going to get lucky tonight, probably with another girl that looks just like him"
The takeaway from tonight's game: the Colts' run defense was HUGE. And Curtis Painter rightfully owes us all (us especially) a big finger.
This may be a fact!! RT @RaheemBrock Curtis painter will help the colts win their first game! U heard it here first!!!
