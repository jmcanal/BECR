@OnTheManney @hbryant42 I don't think Nike was ever an option. Part of it may be the small, inexperienced management team he's kept around.

@Spacekatgal @kadybat and if Nintendo came out and said "nope, we declare she is a cis woman" while that may make it "official canon"...
I just read a rumor that the Nintendo NX may not have an optical drive, and I'm just like, "are you TRYING to fail now, Nintendo?"
@jrconway3 @BitnerdGX Sure, it may not be in a direct sense. But Nintendo gives GX the support by sending them coverage and press releases.

@LewieP What a giggle. When 3rd parties were DESPERATE to work with Nintendo.
Honestly, lack of 3rd party support should have been expected. its not the company's fault for not siding with Nintendo
@ZeroSHEARER @ZhugeEX again an improvement. I don't like barely any Nintendo first party exclusives. It's ALL about 3rd party on all systems
Nintendo Chief Satoru Iwata Dies At 55
@THEREALRTU but then I suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe Nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... Lol
@16KTS @Flareonys Nintendo needs some more 3rd party reps, but at the same time that's what makes them pure.

My long shot dream announcement tomorrow from Apple: Apple TV video games include a partnership with Nintendo.
@BlazeRuler Nintendo may have wanted to make it E10+, so they left him out. I dunno, probably not true
@JediPrince84 I bought Rayman Legends just to have some simple fun. I can't wait for Nintendo to sink and become a 2nd/3rd party developer
It would be poetic if Nintendo became a Sony 2nd Party Developer. It would also make choosing consoles every generation very easy
Apparently Super Mario Maker comes out on the 11th of September. I guess it's Nintendo's way of saying "just bloody rebuild them already".
Can't believe Nintendo is finally allowing it. Wow. Pretty excited for Afterbirth too. Might actually buy it for PC. https://t.co/kGrvFkWAyJ
What if tomorrow Apple is just like, "the Apple TV is now a game console and we're going to take on Sony and Microsoft (and Nintendo)" lol.

"Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch, and this Sunday... I'm gonna make sure mine." *drops mic* DAAAAAMN Cena. #RAW
Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch, but Sunday Cena will make Rollins his.   Wow #RAW
Rollins you better win on sunday at #Summerslam! I do not want Super Cena to tie Ric Flair's 16-Time World Title reigns. #Raw #TitleForTitle
"HHH was never Ric Flair's bitch, Sunday I'm going to make you mine"
"HHH was never Ric Flair's bitch. This Sunday...I'm gonna make you mine" @JohnCena mic dropped. Promo made. @WWE

@JustinLaBar "Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch. But this Sunday in gonna make you mine." SCRIPTED. Well delivered. But scripted.
Best John Cena mic speech ever! "HHH was never Ric Flair's bitch; this Sunday I'm a make u mine!" That was badass! #TitleForTitle
You may break the record, but you're no Ric Flair, Mr Cena
Imma cry if Cena win the WWE Title this Sunday. There is no way he should tie Ric Flair's record for most world title reigns
"Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch, but this Sunday, I'm gonna make you mine!" No pressure Rollins, look at that look from HHH! #Raw
.@JohnCena Legendary  killing on mic @WWERollins "Triple H  was never Ric Flair bitchh this sunday i make you mine" #RAW #TitleForTitle #NGU
If Cena ties Ric Flair's 16th World Titles, that will truly be a slap in the face of Flair. Ridiculous #RAW
*whispers* Ric Flair is at least a seventeen time World Champion. John Cena won't tie him if he wins on Sunday.
"He may be aiming for Ric Flair, but comes off more like Billy Gunn" ~ anonymous WWE veteran in PWI about Dolph Ziggler.  Wow.

I hope Ric Flair prevents John Cena from getting his 16th title. Wwe write that into the script @TripleH @StephMcMahon
@WWE Ready to see @JohnCena  win the championship for the 16th time.  Tying the legend Ric Flair
Will John Cena tie Ric Flair tonight by winning his 16th world title? #SummerSlam
Title for Title match, winner take all, will it be Seth Rollins or will John Cena become 16th time World Champ &amp; tie Ric Flair?! #SummerSlam
Did you all know that Ric Flair was handed the belt on the 16th time? #SummerSlam
Ric Flair = Beloved Legend. John Cena = Hated by pure wrestling fans.  Even if he wins the 16th title.They won't be Equal EVER! #SummerSlam
@FezzSidd Like Ric Flair's 16th World Title everyone gets all worked up about? Nash literally handed it to him. Lost it about an hour later.
Looking forward to Monday Night Raw, I have a feeling we'll be seeing Ric Flair in the ring with Sting tonight! #WWERaw #WCW
Ric Flair says he was rooting for John Cena #WWE #RAW - Results: http://t.co/sEX52dUPuH http://t.co/I2oOUB88ta
Quick reminder to folks agreeing with Jon. Ric Flair's 16th reign came via Kevin Nash handing him the title. He lost it about an hour later.
Wait. Is what Ric Flair saying true? Did Jon Stewart costing @JohnCena the 16th @WWE Title put us in an alternate reality? #RAW

If @MsCharlotteWWE defeats Nikki Bella at #nightofchampions, it Should be similar to how Ric Flair beat Dusty Rhodes to win his 1st title
Maybe the 2nd Monster was a bad idea in hindsight. Feel more amped up than Ric Flair on speed.
The notion Nikki doesn't "deserve" to break the record is laughable. AJ wasn't Ric Flair. Hell, Nikki may be better now than AJ ever was.
22 years ago I saw Ric Flair wrestle at age 3, in the very building I'll see @MsCharlotteWWE wrestle in tomorrow night. Mindblowing!!

Rick Perry has stopped paying staff &amp; rumors of Rand Paul implosion are everywhere. Are these the 1st 2 out?

@Josh_Kimbrell   What time is the town hall meeting @ Anderson w. Rick Perry tomorrow ?
With Rick Perry's campaign unable to pay staffers, it may be time to think about bowing out or catering exclusively to a big donor.
Rest of the children's table is made of wood, except rick perry, who seems to have matured like a college student btw 1st and 2nd semesters
Looks like Rick Perry may be the first out in the #GOP race.  He's out of money already!
Is this the end for Rick Perry? If 2011 hasn't taught him anything, he may as well campaign his way out of Federal #LOCKUP !! AND #LOSE!!
Rick Perry may be the first to drop out. Out of money.  http://t.co/zwmnwXbH0J #GOP2016
I think a big part of Rick Perry's fall is simply that he is not a sitting governor this time around. May be Jeb's downfall too.
Why Rick Perry's campaign's financial woes may not mean as much in the age of SuperPACs. https://t.co/tmjA7pECUv
Rick Perry may have to drop out of the race, before one vote is cast, because he has run out of money. I have mixed feelings about that.

@LeeAdams_4Him purpose of the SCOTUS is to establish constitutionality of laws. they ruled that gay marriage bans violated 14th amend rights

@Billd111 @megynkelly @tedcruz SCOTUS has determined that the 14th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens
@SniffJenkum SCOTUS has no authority to make law. Only Congress may legislate. #SeparationOfPowers #AbuseOfPower
@cspanwj In their recent pro gay marriage decision, SCOTUS has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the United States Constitution.
Clerk #KimDavis is jailed because SCOTUS can see Gay Marriage in the 14th Amend. but Fed.Dist.Judge can't see religious freedom in the 1st.
1A: Congress can't make law preventing religious freedom, so SCOTUS interpretation unlawful Const Trumps case law https://t.co/f4LSUd5ENR
@iSupremeCourt SCOTUS would be hypocritical in re-affirming the 4th circuits ruling, but at the same time HW was kind of broad himself...
@DanThaWildMan Read the 14th amendment. Or maybe you should just read what the SCOTUS says: http://t.co/1hbUefu2l4
@topdrive496 SCOTUS says it is already in Constitution, 14th amendment.  Don't need new laws for that.
the kim davis case is just a sample of what's coming  to gun owners when SCOTUS decides it wants to redefine the 2nd amend
@Lrihendry @ChristieC733 what's scary is that it was only 5-4. Like our SCOTUS, Irving may flip on one vote.
Billy the Kid - Billy Get Your Guns https://t.co/3d02aklgud via @YouTube better get it before SCOTUS redefines the 2nd amend
@alphainparis 14th Amendment is the one used by SCOTUS in the marriage equality ruling. @gshevlin
@tedcruz our 14th amendment is also under attack, which one do we chose? oh yeah it's up to SCOTUS and they ruled!
@RushedLimbo you're literally incapable of intimidating me. anyways SCOTUS interprets the constitution. mar equality is the law of the land
Searching for marriage in the 14th Amendment; how SCOTUS usurp powers that it does not have under the Constitution. https://t.co/jFh4Hd6fYe
@angiezwick which was declared unconstitutional by SCOTUS as a violation of the 14th Amendment...so that's been settled.
@SteveThomasNow @Pontifex bottom line, it should be a Woman's Right to Privacy, as SCOTUS says, for 1st/2nd trimester only.
@JimDarcy2 @LTider @RWSurferGirl That law breaks the 14th Amendment, so it is in SCOTUS power to strike it down.
Sorry, billionaires! Might have to go all the way to SCOTUS. Pro tip: Try FULLY FUNDING your projects next time.  http://t.co/8zVJi7wBZV
@chrisbraly   SCOTUS never made law they interpreted it. 14th A guarantees equal rights for all Americans
@thebobbynelson if the SCOTUS decided that the 14th A gave a Muslim woman the right to no longer wear a head scarf, or that marriage
@John_16_2 @MrFuckBringer @LetsBe_Rational as the SCOTUS has interpreted it,the legislation in the 14th amendment protects same-sex marriage
@close_michael @danagould Disastrous? Gore was asking a State Court to violate the 12th Amendment, the SCOTUS stopped them. You disapprove?
@MisterFreedom You may want to learn about what the SCOTUS does.  @Petapup1
@StoneColdChik the panthers are advocating the killing of police, SCOTUS says that "true threats are outside the 1st Amendment so why aren't
@AlphaKruse @suz123nj @papalputz @OtterDose @MatStaver SCOTUS vitiated KY marriage law immediately b/c it violated 14th Amendment
@count_01 SCOTUS based their argument on the 14th. No matter how you stretch it race was not involved.
@ThoughtsOfTony @toddstarnes @ShaePhoenix hi Tony. As usual U pick up the story at a convenient place in time. SCOTUS imposed this on US 1st
@JAmy208 @GaetaSusan SCOTUS has interpreted equal rights under the 14th as such.
#KimDavis appealed Bunnings original order and both the 6th circuit and SCOTUS denied the appeals  Why does she think it'll change now?
@cybrpete so speaks the "soulless zombie" who fails to grasp the SCOTUS decision was based on the 14th amendment #tcot  #constitution
@LarryOConnor @GretchenCarlson U sound like the hated "smartset" now? Is #KimDavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from SCOTUS in history?
@DeepSouthProud @bryanbleano @DynaMoChen the States ensured SCOTUS could take this action by enacting 14th Amendment
Huckabee claims SCOTUS made new law on SSM. No. The equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment is more than a century old.
SCOTUS cannot make law only rule on it. Get real America.  Unless it's healthcare.Then they feel they can.    https://t.co/IyMH2Hbe09
SCOTUS Apparently is Saying That Gays Have an Equal Right to Marriage Under the 14th Amendment.
Ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman, if SCOTUS now writes law, guess Ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish.
all you gun owner better get ready B/C the next thing SCOTUS will be redefining is the 2nd amend
@Xander756 and the 14th amendment as interpreted by the SCOTUS protects gay marriage.
@Pqlyur1 SCOTUS interprets laws, and since by their interpretation it is protected by the 14th amendment it is technically a const violation
@GovMikeHuckabee WAIT WHAT?!?! SCOTUS makes laws!?!? since when? have i been lied to my entire 8th grade year about gov? (sarcasm intended)
@npallitto @TheFive ?Regardless of your position,protocol should be followed in all SCOTUS decisions.Next time it may be one you don't like
@PragmaticEbooks In 8th grade I learned that SCOTUS rulings have the force of law. They never got that far.

@PowerCat46 Read the 14th Admendment, thats were SCOTUS says the power for Gay marriage lays. In the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection

The what's a better show debate, Seinfeld vs Friends is one for the ages but you may be mentally incompetent if you think Friends is better.
Seinfeld may have not known it at the time. But he made the last sitcom that mattered.
I have work tomorrow but I'm still going to stay up and watch Seinfeld...
Let it be know that @judecomputer enjoys Seinfeld. I may have had to force her to watch episodes, but she has chosen to enjoy them.
About to see Ant Man... I don't expect it to be as good as A Bug's Life, Antz, or Seinfeld's "the Bee Movie"... But I may BEE surprised
Seinfeld may be one of the best shows of all time.

My sick day has consisted of watching Seinfeld and Facetiming and it may be the best day I've had all summer.

Impromptu day off tomorrow for an extra long weekend, so I'm treating myself to a pedicure and feeling like I'm in a Seinfeld episode.

@HarveyAraton I may be the only human being in America never watched Seinfeld once, ditto, Friends, all those sitcoms. Only TV for sports.
Friends and Seinfeld (I didn't get cable until 3rd grade so I watched the shows on satellite) https://t.co/FsOjafAt8B
Keith Hernandez on Seinfeld was the best appearance by an athlete on any TV show or movie. 2nd is Mark McGuire on Mad About You.
Plus I got Seinfeld all on DVD Plus I killed the math section on the SAT
I told someone about how I once sat on the floor of my hotel room and watched Seinfeld for hours and they threatened to punch me.
@jellybean1398 watching the last episode 1st is why I skipped watching Seinfeld for MANY yrs. The 1st few yrs at least of Mad Men were good.

Awesome day in Central Park. Looking forward to Seinfeld tour and then NXT Takeover Brooklyn tomorrow  #NXTTakeOverBrooklyn #NXTBrooklyn
To quote Seinfeld's Kramer, Monday has a feel; Wed has a feel, and FRIDAY has a feel. Here's to feeling the first Friday of the school year!
kramer is the best character on Seinfeld. George close second, Newman 3rd.
Popcorn and Seinfeld sounds like the perfect friday night... #ithinkimgettingold
Someone needs to make a Video Compilation of all the SAT vocabulary Cosmo Kramer spontaneously uses on Seinfeld
@ChrisDuel sometimes I forget you're 80 years old. Reading the Sunday paper at 5am...you missed the early bird, Seinfeld
I'm on the floor eating left over spaghetti for breakfast and watching Seinfeld while the baby naps. Must be Monday #maternityleave
Will watch old movies, Seinfeld and other silly things till Sunday...the old #katrina news footage is too much for this heart to bear.

World, I think it may be time to accept that nothing Larry David did after Seinfeld has been funny.
I'm finding my life and the dialogue around me are right out of a Seinfeld episode. Many of you may think this is fun, but it's unnerving.
Stuck in the lodge with Jim the dads army loving sound guy who claims Seinfeld and Friends are the worst shows of all time. I may knife him.
@starbex Or something like NBC's "Blackout Thursday" where they had the lights come back on at 9pm because Seinfeld refused to participate.
Won't be live tweeting the vma's tonight despite what you may have guessed. Watching Seinfeld instead. Thank you.

@Seinfeld2000 something has been bugging me lately. What if Seinfeld was current day? What if brand new episodes came out every Thursday?
Interested to see what kind of ratings the U.S. Open final gets on Saturday with Serena presumably going for history up against CFB.
I'm pretty sure Serena ripped that match winning ace the same time USMNT game up their 3rd.
And with Serena's 11th ace she wins the match vs her sister Venus
History still in the making with Serena's win over sister Venus! #GrandSlam https://t.co/p56xxav8vv
@bgtennisnation Serena can't fool me that 2nd set was a gift to Venus. She didn't want to beat her in 2 easy sets.
I love my Nike players!! Way to go Serena! Expecting great things from you tomorrow, federer!
Serena just needs to win two more matches to win the last 5 majors/4 in a single year/last 4 us opens https://t.co/dwz4tM0HBN
Serena reaches her 7th semifinals of the #USOpen in a row. Two more matches to complete the Grand Slam.
@hbryant42 Venus missed so many neutral shots in 3rd set that she never let Serena feel the pressure; she let her off the hook, in a way.
One of the most beautiful moments in tennis history! Nice hug! Serena defeats Venus in their 27th face-to-face... http://t.co/GPtPn3SWvO
Serena won, but big sister Venus gave her the flux! Congrats to both of them for giving us a great tennis match. https://t.co/brJ29dzm2X

Happy for Serena. I want her to win the 22nd GS, tie Steffi and win the CYGS. @usopen #usopen
I hope every young girl watched the Williams sisters tonight. Serena may have won but they'll go down as the greatest sibling duo ever!
Serena is emotionally drained. Hope she has time to rest up before Thursday.

Serena be lettin oponents comeback in the 2nd set just to make the media feel better. That good #SerenaVsVenus

Serena may have taken that match, but Venus wins.  So much class.  Just a good person. The same cannot be said about her sister.  #veealways
@MauriceBear21 she may beat Steffi or Serena's Open Era Record of titles, who knows at this point.
@AlexSanderNYC How can you give people tips to better their lives when u just sat on here slandering Serena over her body? #GetAGripSir

Couldn't hang on to stay up and watch 3rd set but it was nice to see Serena beat Venus. What a resilient, tough player Venus is, tho.

Letting your professors know not to schedule a final on December 17th and 18th because That's the Star Wars premiere....Yeah, I'm that kid
#ForceFriday as a whole was pretty disappointing. Not sure who dropped the ball - retailers, Hasbro, or Disney. It's Star Wars! C'mon!

@Pillownaut 1978. I missed Star Wars and Saturday Night Fever but made it in time for Grease, so there's that.
Who wants to go see Star Wars ep 7 with me in December?
Why is it the Imperial March from Star Wars is playing im my head while I think about a new episode of #inkmaster tonight?? Lol
I have a Star Wars themed birthday party this Saturday. But here's the downside..
When we go over expectations, I make it fun with Star Wars-- the Jedi Code of Conduct. http://t.co/67J9CcUea5 #sdu46
Just discovered the complete first season of Star Wars rebels is available for free On Demand. Tomorrow's work day just got AWESOME.
@TOPPSMIKE I also cross trade for huddle and bunt. I may quit Star Wars and want to cross trade. Don't want to be suspended again. Thoughts?
Can December 17th get here any faster? I want to watch Star Wars already
@rebelrealcanon Nothing wrong with that. I was in 4th grade when Episode I was released. I'd seen the OT before, but TPM is my Star Wars!

And the show goes on! Scorpions' Sting at 3 p.m. Come down; the sun is even peeking through.
He's still wrong about Sting :) https://t.co/SgqnnXStdZ
Sting will interfere and cost Undertaker the match this sunday. Or, it's possible we could see the return of the masked Kane. #SummerSlam

Sting's in Brooklyn. Sunday night, it's happening. IT'S HAPPENING! #SummerSlam
@JGoldLabel Doubt it. Rumor has it Kane may attack Lesnae because Lesnar "Put him out" Sting shows up sets up Taker vs Sting Mania 32
[150823 Moo Party] Mamamoo sang Sting with live piano 1st then back to MR. Pictures/fanarts/messages from MooMoos were shown on the screen.
@TheDoctorIsntIn Interference seems a foregone conclusion to set up a 3rd match at WM...unless Sting shows up tonight and screws Taker.
If Sting is on RAW tomorrow then there is no doubt he will confront The Undertaker to build towards a match at WrestleMania.
@lentzadam533 yea definitely but I just saw a report that Sting is coming to RAW tomorrow and Taker going be at raw could be interesting
Rumor has it that Sting will appear on #RAW tomorrow night.
@Danielmmafan Sting could always have another match before. I just read hes gonna be on Raw tomorrow.
Sting will be on RAW tomorrow though so that should set up the taker/Sting match
PWInsider reports that several sources indicate Sting flew back to New York City tonight, which could mean he appears at RAW tomorrow night.
@ShadouDoragon @HolyWhiteDragon @IronRockSaint --instead responded to Sting's statement. "Hai, Sting-san! May the guild with more--
"Sting may be apppearing tonight" how many times have we heard that in the last 2 months? I'll believe it when I hear the crows.  #Raw
@FredRichani If you wanna do Rock vs Brock and Taker vs Sting at wm 32. Survivor Series on his 25th anniversary would be the place to end it
Rumor Roundup (Aug. 24, 2015): Raw tonight, WrestleMania, Sting return, Divas Revolution, more! http://t.co/VRDROEKt0E via @cagesideseats.
Looking forward to Monday Night Raw, I have a feeling we'll be seeing Ric Flair in the ring with Sting tonight! #WWERaw #WCW
And it all ends,  with Sting! Monday Night Raw, was absolutely, WAY more better, then Summerslam. #StingVsRollins  #RawBrooklyn
That was one of the best Monday Night Raw shows I've seen in a while, finishing off with Sting! Could we see #RollinsvsSting
Including his TNA title wins, Sting is a 14-time World Champion. Beating Seth would tie him with Cena for 2nd of all time. @wwe #raw
great RAW tonight...1st the Dudley Boys and then to end with Sting!!!   #WWERaw #WWE
@DukesWrestling if Sting is in a Rollins story line who's the next rumored 3rd man for Reigns/Ambrose?
I gotta mute @WWE  on Monday's. Good to see Sting sucks it was in twitter. I guess back to San Andreas it is.
Sting winning at #NightOfChampions results in either Sting vs Taker at Mania or Sting vs Cena and I've got a bad feeling it's the 2nd option
Sting wins title and vacates it the next night on Raw goes in to hall of fame in April....
Sting is back, and the Dudleys return :D Quite an eventful Monday Night Raw on the whole. Lesnar-Dallas though X'D #RawBrooklyn
@ryan24672 @CMPuLs3 And it'd work, Seth getting the rub and being Sting's 2nd ever opponent + a month long reign with both titles is BIG
@Chrissie32NY so tomorrow we should try &amp; plan a trip to see the next PPV as Sting might be world champ!!
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/zDth0kovNW Seth Rollins vs Sting the Returns 2015 WWE Raw, Aug 24
I honestly think I'm still Marking Out from last night's #RAW... 1st the Dudley Boyz...  Then Ric Flair... And then Sting!! :D #WWE
STING vs. Seth Rollins on September 20th for the World Title! Amazing! http://t.co/xoNwHr5Syx
@NickGator well, at least you can see Sting's 1st WWE title win for only 9.99
One issue I had with the Sting stuff, But it also supporting one of my theories during Mania... http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW
@mdschaeff Did you notice how the upper corners of Sting's paint were gone b/c he was in there so long?  "C'mon Seth, take it home."
@grumpyhawk We've already been getting Christmas stuff in at work so I assume we're just prepping for Black Friday even earlier and Sting is
C'mon, Vince...we're not stupid.  We all know Sting's going to job to Rollins to make him look strong.
Loving the Sting stuff &amp; especially loving the way Triple sold it all... STING WAS IN THE BOX! http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW
The Sting stuff just being great &amp; loving how Triple H sold the "big reveal"... http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW
@raschatz Cena with that broken nose. And if Sting is in the title chase, Paul (HHH) may have killed that Cena-Rollins feud.

@titowrestling c'mon you wouldn't mark out if Sting was champ? Granted I realize Rollins ain't dropping the strap to him but for nostalgia?
@WRESTLEZONEcom Do you guys think "The Icon" Sting will ACTUALLY get his 1st victory in WWE? If so, when and where will he get it?! #WZDaily

Wonder if Sting will be able to speak with his actual voice on #Raw on Monday, or if they'll dub him over like a movie trailer again.
I hope Sting spends his time at #RAW tomorrow complaining about how long he had to stand behind that curtain while @WWERollins went on &amp; on
@WWE @Sting @USA_Network  WCW guys will not win WWE World title..Sting deserves it but WWE still think it's a Monday night War
That statue's going to be demolished via Sting's bat. https://t.co/ni8VfDd5VK

I know Sting says this is Monday Night #Raw, but it feels a lot more like Monday Nitro to me
Even if it's an announced segment, I still mark out when Sting is on my TV on Monday nights. #RAW
#StingonRaw what a great way to start off Monday night Raw with Sting!
And @TripleH may have " hand picked " @WWERollins but @StephMcMahon and Sting is right- Rollins is not half the man HHH is. #RAW
Instead of that, Sting has to suck up to Hunter. I realize it may be planting a seed for HHH/Rollins, but I hate dumb faces.
He may be 56, but Sting is still as passionate as ever and still has the fire. Still awesome on the mic. He and Rollins will be M-O-N-E-Y.
Going on record, Sting wins belt at NoC, drops it at the MSG show on the 3rd. If I'm wrong, ya can have open season on me.

Is Tiger Woods form finally returning or is it a one off. Unlucky lip out on 18th but an aggressive putt.

On Saturday, a record number of fans showed up at the Wyndham Championship. Most, of course, were there to see Tiger Woods
There is just something about a Sunday afternoon with Tiger Woods wearing red that is American
It's Sunday. Tiger Woods dressed just like Patrick Reed. (Lest we forget) #AtTheWyndham http://t.co/EmVoWtVAYE
Break out the Sunday red. Tiger woods is back. America is back. http://t.co/DRPeA9oLTk
Not sure I wanted Tiger Woods to win a golf tournament more than I do today. Swallowed the pride, showed up and delivered. C'mon big cat!
We're about to get a Sunday round of golf with Tiger Woods actually in contention. Wearing red of course. #flashbacks
It's weird seeing Tiger Woods being able to wear red again. Not too often that he makes it to Sunday now a days.
Tiger Woods rocking the red polo on a Sunday with a chance to win the tournament. Doesn't get much better than that
Why is the @WyndhamChamp 1st tee announcer screaming? Because it's Tiger Woods, that's why.
Davis Love and Tiger Woods challenging on a Sunday...is it the 90s?
Of course Scott Brown aces the 3rd. From way downtown, BANG. (Note: Scott Brown is playing with Tiger Woods this afternoon.)
Tiger Woods' group comes to the Par 3-3rd and there's an ACE! But it wasn't from Eldrick - Scott Brown makes it w/Tiger looking on #PGATOUR
Tiger Woods won't win and thankfully this will be the last time we see him til October
After watching Tiger Woods the 1st 6 holes today; he is NOT going to win!  Not looking tough!
Golf -  Tiger Woods gets close at the Wyndham, and the US media are orgasmic!!! C'mon Paul Casey!!

I was 2 optimistic yesterday when Tiger Woods was in 1st place..predicting he'd finish out of top 10. Should've been 20 #WyndhamChampionship
Tiger Woods is the biggest tease of the entire weekend. In contention and blows it on Sunday. Next step play 72 holes instead of 54.
I'm here watching golf hoping Tiger Woods can do well and this ass hole Triple bogey the 11th hole!!!
Video: Tiger Woods carded a 7 on the par 4 11th, here's the 5 shot carnage around the green https://t.co/ioLqv9lT06
Do we have thoughts on the ORO Tiger Woods theory can't go 4 days TR - 7 birdies Friday - 5 birdies, eagle Sat - 3 birdies Sun - 1 birdie
One bad chip and Tiger Woods triples bogeys the par-4 11th. Falls to 10 under and more or less loses all chance to make the playoffs
Tiger woods just ruined Sunday for America.
Tiger Woods with a triple bogey on a Sunday with a chance to win? What world are we living in? I'm sad.

Tiger Woods 11th hole - blade a chip, chunk the following chip, hit the next chip thin, two-putt for triple bogey. Every amateur rejoices.

Well, at least killing the douchebag is as entertaining as wondering how many times Tom Cruise died in Edge of Tomorrow #BloodPunch
Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation: I really tried, you guys, but I can only like Tom Cruise once per decade and Edge of Tomorrow was SO GOOD.

Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise is another bad ass movie; I have never seen it till now.

@Rockerq They will not be safe. We will march on Clapton with lead piping and beat UKIP into the sea.
@Nigel_Farage, thanks to @petersththanet whatever credibility UKIP may have had has just been lost forever. http://t.co/Aa0eoRW0UM
@IsabelHardman Id be prepared to bet that most Sun readers voted UKIP despite them backing the Tories.
We've gone from a country that voted UKIP into 3rd place for total votes, the party looking to seriously cut the amount of people coming in
@Tweet4Labour UKIP polled 2nd in Labour-held seats in the north, if we continue with Tory-lite policies then UKIP will crush us in the north
@GudBadAnFozzy @davidsmith42000 @LBC You said he was the 2nd worst, he isn't &amp; UKIP don't vote on non-UK issues
@paulwaugh to be fair Paul, after SNP, UKIP, Boundary changes &amp; 50 fewer MPs, it may not be leader that's influencing the 80% who disagree
Buzzfeed asks if UKIP loses votes to Corbyn; Farage thinks he'll pick up some Greens/non-voters but a chunk of old Labour vote may go UKIP.
Yes, but UKIP said the Dad only did it for new teeth. Or some other sick nonsense.  https://t.co/s599qsRkcU
@YorksSocialist @robertsjonathan @southcoastbloke Kendall &amp; Cooper would cause a UKIP surge in the north where the party polled 2nd
@BaronGraham I understand why people may support them, but I totally despise UKIP. They're racist bigoted beasts, nothing average about that
UKIP are the only party offering sensible policies on immigration.  https://t.co/5qza8XTFo6   https://t.co/pgPoVNhOhg

@JamieRoss7 @mrjamesob I don't think she understood UKIP  at all. Suggest Nuttily Bennett may be more in step with her views
Great to hear you on BBC5Live on Wednesday. Nearly fell off my chair at UKIP inclusion #bbcbias https://t.co/tOmghdaUGB
The same ppl who voted UKIP in May are only defending migrants coming to the UK because it seems like the 'conscientious' or 'right' answer.
If there were an election tomorrow,UKIP still wouldnt get a great number of MP's,I hate to say it but I think this country is about finished
Remember cameron promised you all this b4 the election 1st class treatment to A/s should have voted UKIP u were warned by Farage
@davidcamerbot  @ed_mili_bot will tomorrow lie about UKIP's record, and try again to appeal to North London's champagne socialist clique!
Never forget. UKIP share a platform in the EU Parliament with these. Hope UKIP voters are suitably ashamed. http://t.co/99khTJeJsl
@nathggns Labour amendment, likely supported by the SNP, green and UKIP. Some eurosceptic tories may support it - it'll be close
Thursday Blackheath By Election. Vote UKIP. You know it makes sense. http://t.co/Xxb1AKBEbT
@Tim_Aker I think an emergency council meeting is needed. We trusted UKIP at the last election and there's an important by election Thursday
"@DavidJo52951945: I hope UKIP's Thanet Council refuse to take any refugees or immigrants &amp; say they are putting the needs of Brits 1st"
Deplorable and wrong-headed comments by Bristol's only UKIP councillor. I hope he loses his seat in May and UKIP fold http://t.co/l4k1GggRlm
Looking forward to @OwenJones84 becoming a Tories or indeed UKIP leader one day....... http://t.co/EqE5JvTesW
@freedmanhp4 @JohnRentoul @lordbonkers May be good news for UKIP too though Corbyn is the most Eurosceptic leader since Michael Foot.

Zlatan to Milan may not be the best thing for both parties, He will be going to an un settled club, new coach (very tough personality) 1
@Ibra_official Your record of moving to a new country and winning the league is 2nd to none! Man Utd need ZLATAN and ZLATAN needs the EPL..
@ACM_Nicky Till Zlatan comes. He''ll play for PSG in the Super Cup on August 1st, then he's ours.
Zlatan is still a beast. If he's replacing RvP then it's good business  https://t.co/M2IZ9Vv5KG

Friend with connections just offered to let me meet Zlatan &amp; Co. in NJ tomorrow. Alas, my body sucks and I cannot.
So, about Zlatan... I don't want him. All reports are that he's not a good teammate. He'd be our 3rd DP Fwd, how do you work the 3 together?
Manchester United v PSG Wednesday night. This time, I'll root for Zlatan the gawd.

Zlatan is the 5th highest paid athlete in the world
French super cup tomorrow... Zlatan's future should be confirmed in the day after that.
@mattoak I still say it's Monday after Zlatan finishes game on Sunday... They're just prepping. They'll tease enough to gather the media.
Zlatan is a doubt for Friday's game at Lille with sprained ligaments in his knee. He had to be strapped up during the game last night. #PSG
@JenniferWegerup Hey Jennifer. What is your source for your article about Zlatan will be in Istanbul on the 6th of aug. Thanks a lot.
@_mindy_ @RetroUnited coz of Zlatan talking how he loves a fight. May make him show LVG just how he is truly world class.
Orun ni zlatan sun niyen smh"@ZIatanFacts: Zlatan once went to a movie, and it watched him for two hours. #ZlatanFacts"
I don't want to wake up tomorrow, without Zlatan. #Galatasaray @Ibra_official
Ibra recovery time is still unknown, the French League starts on Friday. PSG will play Lille, Zlatan is very much in doubt for that.
@MinoRaiola just because your hunger for more money Zlatan will play in a team that finished at the 10th place and struggle for top 5,shame

@MrTransferNewss @FootbaIISources considering I'm 31st, it looks like Zlatan's about to disappear.
Zlatan's 20th goal of the season not enough for who concede twice late on to draw 2-2 with Caen...
when ppl r going crazy about the 1st day of #BPL, Zlatan's just being Zlatan. Buy his...whatever that he's selling!! http://t.co/h92lHCTTk8

#BWFC Manager Neil Lennon has said Saturday's 0-0 with Derby , illustrates just why he's been chasing Zlatan &amp; Neymar all summer long #SSNHQ
@nananavy That &amp; Zlatan insisting on playing through pain for the 2nd half vs. Lyon. Why not just come off? 2-0 up anyway.
Watching a replay of the PSG / Lille match from Friday. No Zlatan makes PSG unwatchable.
@Jon_LeGossip Any truth to Galatasaray having made an informal offer to PSG for Zlatan? Is he fit to play this Sunday?
@Paulkurth that 3rd shot looks like its from a Michael Bay movie. Zlatan just revealed himself to be Optimus prime.
@ACMilanNorway anyway, telling Zlatan he'll be the center of the team is like telling the sun it's the center of the solar system. No crap.
7 more days till we start the campaign that will win us our 19th scudetto ! Zlatan or no Zlatan that trophy is ours. #ForzaMilan
The VP of France's refereeing union Laurent Ugo has said he accepts Zlatan's apology following the striker's rant at officials on Sunday.
Apparently Zlatan may leave PSG for United. He's already at a team that buys every high rate payer and wins fuck all, not sure why he'd go.
OH NO, we supposedly pull out of Pedro deal as Zlatan becomes available. Please god I'll go church every Sunday if u make this not happen
Zlatan , will your perfumes make me perform overhead kicks .&lt;3 https://t.co/q9tVV95mlr
Sun are so full of shit they say PSG trying to replace Zlatan with Neymar hahaha
Reserving the right to put Milan 3rd if Zlatan arrives
Zlatan is simply saving himself for the 2nd leg
@DaveEllis11 @klavierstuk but if Zlatan is available for a reasonable fee, it may well be worth going for, for an immediate solution.
@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !
The top 4 strikers in the world are not for sale and our coach can't handle the 5th (Zlatan)
I would love to have cavani man. He's over shawdowed and played 2nd fiddle to Zlatan he would shine at arsenal
@Jon_LeGossip I didn't think they will sell either. Maybe Rabiot but surely Cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to Zlatan anymore

@Keith_Russell I don't want it to be but it may be Austin. Obviously prefer Zlatan, muller, Lewandowski etc #mufc
We held talks with PSG on Thursday for Zlatan name now confirmed to me but this is two days old news
@rhysllew26 I reckon we'll get him next season! Zlatan for this year! Get the swagger in! You going tomorrow?
Zlatan is looking mighty attractive at the moment,if LVG doesn't get a striker by Tuesday, I really don't fancy us scoring goals this season
Wonder if Zlatan will be a United player come Tuesday night, think he may be the only realistic option of a big name signing.
Today United should have done better, the referee didn't help at all!!!!  Rooney to 10 pls! Just sign Zlatan tomorrow pleeeeeeze
If there is a silver lining this shows LVG if we dont buy anyone b4 Tuesday we is fucked!! Fuck it i would take Zlatan!!
If Wenger is in Paris. Could it be for Cavani or Zlatan?Then again he may be on a family break.
Ok ed let's do this, Zlatan, greizmann and Laporte tomorrow make it happen
Goal level: Zlatan  90k by Friday? = Posting every other day  #DSGS (Vine by @ElexAuerbach) https://t.co/BPUM3A8tSD
@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price
Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC
Noooooo! I was hoping to see Zlatan being Zlatan in Tuesday! Oh well, still looking forward to the match.  https://t.co/swGyd9cQAJ
@Fronsoir Zlatan has never done it on a wet Tuesday night at Stoke tbh

I didn't think this was possible, but my Apple Watch has 13% battery left right now &amp; I last took it off the charger Tuesday around 8AM
Is it true? Is it true? Apple Watch's here? (Para namang may balak ako bumili hahahaha)
My Apple Watch just told me to stand up.... but I haven't even sat down yet...

@Just_nne2605 did the team score goals? Did they beat City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Draw Chelsea ? How about that for sneaking into 4th
@MrCliftonville @ghosty1879 He kept them up for the 1st year in the EPL,with wins over ManU, Arsenal &amp; Spurs. which is &gt; winning promotion.
An Amazon delivery on a Sunday is as unpredictable as Arsenal on transfer deadline day.
I guess having 3 main teams is the best way to go about it, going with Arsenal,PSG, and a 3rd one I can't  think of atm
lol he's better than any United centreback, would be 4th choice at Arsenal https://t.co/S5uTdqxI79
@Giroudesque Gabriel doesn't even make Arsenal's 1st team, enough said.
@goonersteve12 . So long as Arsenal finish 4th, CL is confirmed, Mr Wenger will remain as manager. Realistically, we can not win the PL.
@JHickin it doesn't matter where they play, what matters is they play for Wales, better than England, may I add! (P.s, Ramsey is Arsenal)
Excellent performance tonight from @MCWFC looking to see you against Arsenal next Sunday
@gilchrist450 @BlueStu1872 How much was he signed for? Did it make a dent in Mr King's warchest or is he going back to Arsenal in January?
Take Welbeck being unable for the Euros with a pinch of salt. Pretty sure we'll see him in an Arsenal shirt come May.
Arsene Wenger admits Arsenal must be "more realistic" about their Premier League title chances after losing 2-1 at Swansea City on Sunday.
@ibster45 Even if Arsenal admits he's out 6 months, we're not making a major signing in Jan... that's if we make any signings at.

Yo! Chelsea! remember when Barca said Fabregas was poo poo in the 2nd half of the season. No refunds
@NariahCFC against barca pre season stand out player 1st half.. I dunno what's going on with us atm frustrating to see us lose
Vermaelen starting for Barca 2nd time in a row. Didnt think he'd play that much for them.
Neymar playing his last game for Barca before he signs for us on Tuesday I see #PigsMightFly
@mediocentroEN that he's a 4th choice CB at Barca and has started two games?
@noelle_cruz Think they put him number 3/4 These Sky Sports Pundits are pro Barca,  spent ages talking about Messi's win on Thurs.
We now just need less than 4.5 goals in the Barca match and Real match to land the 32/1 7-fold. I may cover our bet before the last match
Let's go Barca 1 goal before the 1st half ends.
I hope that Barca does a lot more better in the 2nd half then in the 1st half.
@fcbarcelona surprise, surprise! Barca has the upperhand, but it seems Malaga has their 12th man, the ref is so bias. #CampNou #FCBMalaga
I honestly think what we're seeing with Fabregas is really him and why Barca were quick to part ways. Last August-November was a one-off
I can't believe the last time Barca scored against Malaga was in January 2014, that's odd. My money on Malaga to win tonight #bbceurofooty
Soccer Saturday! Watching Barca with my nerd right now and then going to see the Armada tonight!
Again, awful from Barca. Not the best result, they should get 3 goals or more. Calderon on the 12th, serious.
Vermaelen the hero for Barca: Thomas Vermaelen was the unlikely hero as Barcelona laboured to a 1-0 home win over Malaga on Saturday ...
@ChampionsLeague @realmadriden @FCBarcelona @LigaBBVA Barca may have more points but Real Madrid play the better football
#Barca Did Florentino Perez make the schedule in La Liga? Barca's 1st 4 away games all against top 8 teams; RM plays Sevilla &amp; 3 creampuffs.
@jodynotjodie Same. Knackered. I'm going into town tomorrow to watch it. Probably go Barca on the locks. Where you watching it?!
Pedro sat bench for Barca &amp; KDB wins POTY in Germany but yet Pedro is the "better" player.
Barca on the other hand could have problems. Must avoid injuries and stay in touch til Jan and probably add 2 more on top of Arda an Vidal
@BenUFO hey ben really enjoyed your set in barca last night, what was the 2nd last track you played? sounded like caribou?
had great time in Barca, also made some profit which is always nice. Back to the online grind for the sunday today #vamoooos #lfg

(Assuming Barca are the best team in the world) Who is the 2nd best in your opinion?
@Mattyy_Official It solves part of the problem but the jigsaw still has some big gaps that need addressing by 6pm tomorrow! Enjoy Barca!
For football fans, it's transfer deadline day. For us, barca fans, its just another Monday :v
@RafaelH117 @DianaKristinne  do you guys think if Barca reaches January as leaders they can win the League and whether team can achieve that
@EPHowie Did you not see my reply? Barca's front 3 tomorrow. Don't EVEN @ me.
Plus, Atleti still killing it. My heart may belong to Barca but I love the competition. First place may not be so predictable. (2/2)
@lewis59453181 yer some Argentinian kid from Barca is flying in tomorrow, apparently Traore has told him it's good at villa.
Does Barca's transfer ban expire after tonight or on the last day of december?
@_suprene @sinTripas_ if he can play then I hope he plays against barca, on the 20th
So De Gea will be just like the Barca situation, can't play but is basically at the club because he should leave when January comes
If DDG is stuck here till Jan, can we offer him to Barca just to annoy Madrid even more.
Madrid and Barca run the La Liga, not a chance DDG won't be a Madrid player by tomorrow.
Of course it will be, When Barca can sign a player inspite being banned from signing, Why not Real get 1 minute. https://t.co/c6kXXMyfFb
Can we just really piss Madrid off and sell De Gea to Barca in January
@cottonballfc very true I wish they would accept but I think we have a shot to get him in January and fight Barca for him what do you think?
@halamufc @swagattt @joelsimondsouza Personally I think Utd should just tell Madrid, the deal is gone and then in January sell DDG to Barca
Barca may have the best players, but they are miles away from having the best team. Look at that shit def. #barca https://t.co/N3uFl2XIam
Barca fans when they saw "UEFA will study the case tomorrow. They will make a decision on the De Gea case" http://t.co/BmV0wbjeoy
@ChampionsLeague @FCBarcelona barca will successfully defended the title, with the arda and aleix in January plus MSN I don't see them lose.
@tigeramer10 @SergeMUFC .. Which they won't do as they are facing a transfer ban akin to Barca. Even De Gea going January misses the CL.
He was in the Atletico academy, Real is the biggest team in Europe next to Barca. All his friends are in Madrid. LOL https://t.co/AiCHWLTiU8
@AnderJuanderful when managers/players make it a matter of their ego then things always go bad. That's his problem.. 2nd stint at Barca e.g
Barca won the treble and had a transfer ban yet they signed two players. Arsenal came 3rd in the BPL and they didn't buy an outfield player
@The__Fundraiser Barca turned down the opportunity and experimented with Suarez. Bayern haven't opened a cheque yet[Have 1st preference]
@RafaelH117 he's a fraud who will be gone by May. Bet you weren't saying this when he was at barca
@jamiepowell07 its the dogs, ye its amazing and defo go to a barca game, the 1st footie game ive enjoyed in years
Ben Lederman may well end up being the first American to play for Barca but, for the time being, it sounds like he's heading to Florida.
Definitely Liverpool's anthem is the best, 2nd is Barca's one, love it!

Then everton will get the player from Barca on loan :) https://t.co/n1vOyCdFiy

@Hayles_101 the chap is in his 2nd season of a 3 year deal. He has done the business at barca and Munich and I'm sure he will do it for us.
@christhomas1190 he'll be ready in January for Barca!!
@andrewmperry the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now.
Can't wait for Arda to play with Barca, January na pls! https://t.co/RWRRFgDnf0
@Oo_Gho_Gho So Neymar being fifth and Eden being 6th shows nothing other than Barca did better than chelsea in the CL.
We are not Real Barca or Bayern that players would be ready to join the club as a 2nd/ 3rd choice. On what grounds would you bench Coq/Santi
@Kayboy_007 he should walk straight to barca's 1st team.
Slowly getting my last bits pulled together for Barca! Gonna get everything finalised today so I can just relax tomorrow :)
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
@FFC_JM @adidasUK may all the power of Barca and Messi be with you this season!
Neymar shockingly starts playing for Brazil like he does for Barca https://t.co/RSuKe3s16i
I hated Tata Martino in Barca and I can't stand him coaching Argentina! Even though it's a friendly no reason to play 5 defenders in 1st 45

Murray has given it his all, which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but Federer just unbreakable. TB 2nd set. #CincyTennis
Federer stays winning. Into the finals tomorrow.
Federer beats Murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach #CincyTennis final. He'll be going for his 7th title vs Novak Djokovic, who is going for his first
Way to go Roger. Old man Federer just keeps rolling along. #Djokernole v. #Fed for the final tomorrow. #CincyTennis
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
@SkySportsNewsHQ the news should be Federer qualifies for 8th Cincinnati final. Not Murray knocked out.
Federer will play another final tomorrow. This guy is just amazing. #CincyTennis
Excited for the Federer vs. Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. Should be some great tennis!
Serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. Joins Djokovic and Federer in tomorrow's #CincyTennis singles finals. Decent trio.

So Djokovic beats Federer and Murray stays at no 2. Mon the djoker! #CincyTennis
Djokovic looks physically better than against Goffin &amp; Dolgopolov, he may beat Federer today; probably he played only 70-80% in previous RDs
Federer will have to serve into the sun here.
Djokovic up 6-5 in the 1st set.  Federer leads Djokovic in all-time tiebreaks, 11-10.  #tennis
Love this new trick that Federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. Running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
Federer will be 2nd seed at @usopen if he wins this. Djokovic aiming to become 1st player to win all 9 Masters 1000 tournaments #CincyTennis
Federer takes the opener 7-6(1) against Djokovic. Better player in the set &amp; winning plenty behind the 2nd serve. http://t.co/U2hbTK5qMC
Federer breaks early in the 2nd set! Even consolidates the break! Up 3-0! #RF #Tennis #CincyTennis
Federer's a man with a mission... 7th one coming.. #CincyTennis

For the 1st time, Federer has beaten No.1 and No.2 players in the ATP Rankings in consecutive matches en route to a title. #CincyTennis

Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!
23rd of August was such a nice day, England lift Ashes, Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati.
"Papa you need a hat" thus said one of Federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning Cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer
Federer overtakes Lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the US Open in the Open Era. 15th straight year. Connors leads with 18.

Are they holding the Davis Cup semi at the US Open?! @andy_murray v @NickKyrgios , 1st round. Later: Anderson, Wawrinka, Federer, Djokovic?
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!

@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1. His draw is tricky. So is Murray's.If Fed reaches the QFs, then he may meet Berdy.
I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow!
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss.
@camerondallas Federer is about to begin his 2nd round. Go watch it.
Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.
Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!
Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!
Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round
Last year, majority of the Federer matches took place primetime.  This year, it's the other way around.  2nd on Ashe tomorrow
@SJauhar I keep trying to book as soon as I learn when Federer's playing - too late. Nosebleed seats for 4th round (!) going at $250.
The 1st week of the 2015 #USOpen is almost up &amp; the big names of Serena, Venus, Djokovic, Murray, Federer &amp; Wawrinka are still in the draw.
@mmunro91 I may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than I just saw, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic included. Make no mistake,
Fognini is I believe only the 3rd one to beat Nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) Federer and Djokovic.
Most Masters 1000 titles (27) 2nd most Grand Slam titles (24 tied with Sampras after Federer's 17)
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen
Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!
Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd
Just like in the 2nd, Federer breaks back.
Just got to watch Federer win 4 consecutive points to get the decisive break in the 3rd set before mom snatched the remote citing god!
Roger while having trouble with serve, he is still through to 4th round! Federer might face Isner in 4th round
5 time @usopen champion Federer defeats 29th seed Kohlschreiber and he's through to the last 16 to play 13th seed Isner or Vesely! #USOpen
Federer is through to his 15th straight 4th round at the US Open. He's 8-4 with two other wins by walkover. http://t.co/p36dNjyxkV
Shriver to Federer suggesting that he not use the SABR vs. Isner "You want to have your 3rd set of twins I'm sure."  Interview ended there.

Federer's next match is going to be the 1st obstacle he faces on his way to the finals. His first serve needs to be on point against Isner.

Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
Federer saved 4 BP (from 0/40) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set.
'Sneak Attack By Roger' (SABR) causing errors this game for Federer. May be it's Isner's height #USOpen2015
Ok time to check back in with tennis - Isner and Federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el
Wow, Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves. Fed 0/8 on bps tonight
Federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. #USOpen
Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... Lol wow
In French Open QF, Federer didn't break serve -- 1st time in Slam match in 13 years. Tonight he breaks for 1st time in his last return game.
i out of 11 breakpts converted-not nearly good enough by Federer at #USOpen2015 . C'mon, Deliciano, you can beat Novak- Believe !
Disappointing end to the match for Isner. Would've liked to see a 3rd set tiebreak but Federer is a robot. He's ridiculous.
@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak
Federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the ATP Finals after reaching the US QF #FinalShowdown http://t.co/ugI3PQBp8w
With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g

@Shake4ndBake will probably give it another try in the future. I wasn't into Game of Thrones at 1st try, but I kept watching &amp; it grew on me
Really tired! Great day! Going to put my feet up and watch Game Of Thrones maybe Agents Of Shield. Night! Cya tomorrow!
3 more seasons of Game of Thrones? C'mon! You can at least make 10 seasons...right? Is that too much to ask? Ok, 3 is fine.
So, as someone who just got the Game of Thrones 2nd ed LCG, what websites should I be going to for decklists, discussions, etc.?
The emotional rollercoaster that is watching the entire 5th season of Game of Thrones in a single day has come to an end.

@MarkKreidler I'm one of the few who agree with you about Game of Thrones. I also tried the 1st season and gave up. Dark doom and gloom.
So I'll start watching the 1st season of Game of Thrones tonight. Weee :)
Game of Thrones season 5 for free may seem too good to be true, but that's only cause it is. My day went back to being terrible.

Hannibal has been the most amazing show on NBC. I really hope they get a 4th season. Bryan Fuller is amazing #Hannibal #HannibalFinale
At the ending, there're oysters on Hannibal's table. How considerate Hannibal is ...but c'mon Will needs fishes #Hannibal #HannibalMicDrop
ugh also i forgot hannibal is ending...i never kept up with it but i still feel pretty sad it was a damn good show, 1st season
ugggggggh I want to watch Hannibal finale but I am too tired. Perhaps when I get up tomorrow I will
ok when I'm sober tomorrow I NEED to talk to people about Hannibal
I'm just sat here crying over the last episode of Hannibal #bye
@afooltocry @HorrorHoneys It's my uneducated opinion that Breaking Bad is the best show in the history of time.Hannibal might now be the 2nd
@neoprod @GillianA @NBCHannibal well you can't do this all by yourself ... Hannibal is inviting to Dinner and Will may finally accepting him
Hannibal finale on Wednesday in the UK. Time to catch up on all the episodes I missed while on holiday.
Tomorrow I will start catching up on Hannibal. I got to ep2 of S3 and had to stop because I wasn't ready for what a ride it was gonna be.

@theofficialmads may I say sir your portrayal of Hannibal is beautiful and haunting. Hope you get this message. Look forward to ur next work
@WatIsEyebrow noooo not yet. We had a birthday date night last night. Plus I watch it on hulu, which means no Hannibal until Sunday :/
I would've preferred that episode 4 of Hannibal season 3 was the 2nd episode of it. would've been better to check on everyone earlier.
this has also been the 1st episode of Hannibal that had no tension, action or killing at all. also, almost no (new) Hannibal Lecter scenes.
According to my DVR, the penultimate episode of HANNIBAL is just the 4th quarter of a NFL preseason game. I could eat a face.
I may have a massive love-hate relationship with Hannibal but Bryan Fuller's heart has always been in the right place.

Hannibal's 3rd season feels like it became more and more a parody of itself.

I'm getting up at 6 tomorrow so I sticked in and out Hannibal after I realized next episode has the girl waiting under beds to murder people
Okay I'm going to watch Dexter and Hannibal and get high and sleep because fuck Monday.
Holy shit I just now opened the Hannibal's Kitchen envelope someone handed me Friday night #dragoncon #Hannibal http://t.co/v8DX9Jl0Pv
@Illessa Based on the 1st ep, Mr Robot seems a good series to go on to.It looks to respect the audience in the same way as Hannibal, a least
Let's be honest, Hannibal may be many things but he's not a rapist which disgusts me more than killing, cannibalism &amp; everything else.
@SaneCanophilis -- tomorrow." Hannibal squeezed half the contents across his lover's burning cheeks.
@Amirabiabdallah Dexter is great but give Hannibal another try, it gets better after the 5th episode :p
@filmgrabber Michael Marshall shot the hell out of the Hannibal finale. (This movie rules. Loving Maddin Monday)
While I was at Taco Bell I got to thinking about Hannibal. I might not be ready to watch the finale but MAYBE I could watch the 2nd to last.
OK so maybe I'm watching, for the 1st time, the 1st episode of the 1st season of Hannibal and OH MY LORD WHAT IS THIS
@FrygtCanophilis Hannibal removes his hand from your forehead, Will's temperature was back again. He sat down beside the younger man -
@LowriBearman Thank you my love! And I have had a fab day! Distinct lack of Hannibal but I'll put that right tomorrow! xx
@TheEricGoldman Seriously, when people lament they didn't take the 1st possible deal for Hannibal, I tell them go watch Lost in La Mancha.
@FromPillow but idk when i'm gonna get around to hannibal and i know wonderfalls is just a season, so i may just tide myself over with that
I'll be sending off Summer and HANNIBAL tomorrow. It'll be a bittersweet day.
@SkyLivingHD I'm going to be lost without Hannibal on a Wednesday
Several of HNB's staff will be serving at the Early Bird Kiwanis Pork Dinner this Friday the 11th, 11-6 pm at Y's Men Pavilion in Hannibal.
Lots of crime action in Hannibal the past two days... check it out in tomorrow's @hannibalcourier
Jerry Vance may no longer be a Conservative candidate but maybe Harper can name him to the Senate. #elxn42
Unpopular opinion:  Harper is right to think Nats fans ditching in the 7th inning was brutal.  No sure he was right to say it though.
Sorry, Harper, but for once just take the blame. Nats' blew the game.  https://t.co/cQLmq9CofS
Gazette: "Bloc is open to coalition with anyone except Harper, Duceppe says". Of course, anyone may be only NDP. #polcan #elx42
@JohnC1908 I pretty sure none of those fans regret not being there to see Harper strike out in the 9th on a pitch in the dirt.
@Lawson890 @AdamRubinESPN @msimonespn @ynscspds Goldschimdt? for leading a last place team? Harper? may not even make the playoffs lol
I don't much like Harper but he is right to do this. https://t.co/CpgYEqFDzm
Sherman or Harper: Who knows the strike zone better? My column: https://t.co/sTzFrXNXIN
What a tool @Joelsherman1 is once again - Fans leaving in the 7th inning in Washington today is brutal.Period. No reason to go after Harper.
Harper's Worst Offense against Refugees may be Climate Record as rising temperatures add to chaos in the Middle East http://t.co/FqypEHSLKt
But hey, if you're mad at Harper, go to the game tomorrow and tell him how you feel for all 9 innings
iSIS took last oilfield Syria. Harper's 3 bombing runs  may kill civilians not the problem or cause. http://t.co/U37nfqwZ9z #cdnpoli #elxn42
@AdamRubinESPN Harvey thanks you for this scene Harper. Takes the attention off him to pitch tomorrow lol.
I stand with Harper on this. You shouldn't be leaving in the 7th on what essentially is a playoff game. It's not like the game went
There's only one Minister in Harper's pantheon, and he's 100% Prime... (May contain Antibiotics, HGH, GMO...) https://t.co/8zE5Va8HiX
@Misesforever @Liz_Cheney If u keep Harper as PM I may well cross the Lake myself! U have one incredible leader. Balanced budget and all!
@dcsportsbog Harper will issue an apology through the team no later than tomorrow.
If Harper doesn't want fans to leave in the 7th perhaps he and his teammates should stop under performing and losing big ball games? #nats
yeah, Harper went 0-3 tonight. that doesn't mean he doesn't have every right to call out every single fake nats fan that left in the 7th
Choosing to read the transcript of the interview Mansbridge did with Harper due to the extreme 2nd hand embarrassment I'm bound to endure
@bruceanderson I feel it is 2nd rate. Mansbridge doesn't point out when Harper's not answering the question. Debaters would do that.
Watch Harper's toupee suddenly look alot cheaper Oct 20 when our taxes are no longer paying for it. #elexn42
@BrianRoastbeef if you're interested... Mansbridge's Harper interview. Justin tomorrow, Mulcair Wednesday. http://t.co/hUJjpAgMZd
C'mon... It's pretty hard to form the Harper govt without Harper!!! Wait... maybe they have another Harper...  https://t.co/VomvlAJAOT
Now that he's in 3rd place in polls, Harper unveils inspiring new slogan: "I'm not perfect." Circling the drain time. #elxn42 #cdnpoli
Harper,s high standards for candidate selection, Dauphin Swan River MP running for the 3rd time un nominated, stamped by Harper
@newbsradio let's go easy on the pigs. I just can't stand the sight of Harper. It's the 21st century...can't we teach robots to love?
@CBCPolitics Harper the CPC are going to become a 3rd place party because of your reckless leadership #stopharper #cdnpoli #elxn42
But for the first time since the writ was dropped, I really have no idea whether Harper will be PM after Oct 19th, or who would replace him.
David Wright is a beast and Harper needs to come to Philly we will stay till the 9th if you play for us. @Bharper3407
@GUBLERNATION "Harper" looks tired. Do you ever sleep? Then again, I should be too. I have to get up early tomorrow.
Harper, you may not think Justin's ready, but urine over your head.
News in the #DMV: Commuters face "Terrible Traffic Tuesday"; 6 shot, 1 fatally, in 2 DC shootings; Hot, 93; Nats lose, Harper calls out fans
@NEWS957 Harper &amp; cabal insult the intelligence of Canadians on a daily basis. Tired of all the lies &amp; spin. Roll on Oct 19th! #auditthisPOS
Of many single issue reasons to reject Harper. This is one. Imagine the cost of removing all that concrete. #elxn42  https://t.co/hTwpHozGOT
Does Harper even realize there in 3rd place! Talk about burying you head in the sand... Stay the course... Of lies and deceit! #cdnpoli
@jenditchburn It's happened. Harper may try again. What said last night won't matter, it's cling 2 power by whatever means or pogey. #elxn42
@jenditchburn Harper's a 1 trick pony.  Throwing $ from a helicopter doesn't make up for clear lack of CPC vision.  3rd place &amp; dropping.
New CPC ad: Harper may not be perfect, respectful, reliable, accountable, truthful, but... wait where were we going with this?  #elxn42
Harper will be history after Oct 19. His Calgary riding voters should keep it in mind. If he will not be around... http://t.co/cRjmDC67og
@CBCNews Trudeau may do better if he attacked the NDP, no need to waste time on Harper the Media is 24/7 with the anti Harper narrative
@WrightHFX @NDP_HQ you may have principles but lack reality. Liberal far out perform Harper &amp; Mulroney's record. too bad
New election laws crreated by cpc makes it difficult to vote against Harper Even w/ 70% of voters against Harper, he may still win #fixed
so Harper is blaming Del Mar racing another meet for the summer meet's struggle.  Never change California racing.
@lynn_carleton The consortium too. I wanted Harper's hand to be forced &amp; w/ 3rd in polls, he'd have no choice. Mulcair let him off the hook.
"Harper spoke Tuesday on how the Cons will balance their security concerns with more refugees into Canada". Instigating hate #cdnpoli
CPC polling 3rd. Hate polls but I want to believe this. As individual CPC candidates come to realize that Harper is drag to them, Distnce?
Not sure when Harper chat is scheduled to end (may have already), but he's taken 19 questions so far. #cdnpoli #elxn42
@picardonhealth @jdvorkin Yellow journalism.  But you know?  This may be Harper's Waterloo
Harper's NEW AD I am WHO i am not perfect but depend on me for economy  Harper slip sliding down the polls-3rd We KNOW WHO YOU ARE scares US
Super Girls:Dillion Harper gets kinky with April ONeil in saphic massage http://t.co/xZe9xT1oJw  #BigTits http://t.co/qCIfIvvopR
Anyone in Niagara tomorrow should note that Harper will be in Welland. The sulfuric smell won't be coming from the Netherby tunnel for once.
@AdamRubinESPN I'm happy to see the #Nats sat Zimmerman over Harper...Harvey owns Harper #Mets
@Shauncore he could, but Harper has been a freak all year, and Votto's 1st half wasn't amazing.
@MikeWAiken at any rate Harper is sinking fast he is talking resignation after 19 Oct.
Mulcair, Harper and Trudeau still in close race after campaign's 1st phase. Leaders considering time-sharing the country.
Harper may be right, it's pretty empty in Nationals park tonight. #Nats  #Mets
Bryce Harper is 0-18 against Matt Harvey. Harper will lead off the 3rd inning against Harvey. http://t.co/AdEeLdzeoJ
Michael Den Tandt: Harper says he is who he is, take him or leave him. That may not be enough - http://t.co/XyLJ7qAGYV
Due up for #Nats in the bottom of the 5th:  Werth (0-2, .225)  Rendon (2-2, .268)  Harper (0-2, .334)
@ThomasMulcair Thomas, you must use this against Harper even if it did come from Ignatieff.  http://t.co/9dlTXt8Fy5
Harper was right lol, Nats leave in the 7th
@ZuckermanCSN I hope someone asks Harper why the team bailed in the 7th inning
Big spot for Harper now in the 7th to impress the fans left in the park
Shame all the fans that stuck around to see a six run lead blown and Harper make an out for the 8th time in two games. #Nationals
Harper may never get a hit against the Mets the rest of his career #LGM
@dcsportsbog Harper misspoke yesterday. The brutality in the 7th was on the field. Same as tonight. #nats
@maryb889 Still have the 9th &amp; top of order!  Harper walkoff homer!
OK, last chance for the #Nats. It's Werth, Rendon, Harper vs. Familia in 9th, down 8-7.
Werth, Rendon, and Harper due up in the bottom of the 9th, #Nats trail Mets 8-7.
I hope all the fans stayed into the 9th to watch Harper go 0-5. #nats
He's bunting!? That leaves 1st open to walk Harper and set up the DP
#Nats Rendon bunts but Werth is erased at 2nd. Runner on 1st with 1 out.  Harper at bat...
Harper walks. #Nats now have two men on with one out. Escobar will bat next. Still 8-7 Mets in the bottom of the 9th.
@TedStarkey even a successful bunt puts us right they are now 1st and 2nd 1 out after the IBB to Harper. So dumb.
Looks like Harper left in the 7th two days ago.  #Nats  #Splatitude #FireMattWilliams
Harper upset with fans  http://t.co/29S9C9Suk6  When @Bharper3407 runs out every routine grounder to 2nd then he can complain about the fans
@KennyHerzog In this series the Nationals may have lost the division and Harper may have lost the MVP.
@TarekFatah Mulcair, Trudeau and May are all weaklings just like Harper. Mulcair must dubious and dangerous of bunch. Apologist for Isis.
"Where's the sun mommy?" "It's asleep like you should be" "But Harper's a moon mommy"  Dammit kid.
@KoryCPC telling why you should trust Harper. Worth the 10 min. to listen. Not after eating, though.#cdnpoli http://t.co/zG540pZvIU #cdnpoli
@alexboutilier @acoyne @RobertFife  Harper will be at 20% or less on Oct 19.Jenni Byrne is merely a symptom of the problem #cdnpoli #onpoli
Do #mets walk Harper if rendon gets bunt down?  Is Matt Williams under the weather? Pap in 8th facing bottom of order? Left storen out 2 dry
Armed with the tools of power &amp; intimidation Harper is trying to steal our country.  On October 19th, armed with pencils LET'S TAKE IT BACK.
Harper:NDP or Liberal Govt possible Harper's spirit broken tired of so Much Hate against him of his own making Given up the ghost Peace MON
@SouthpawSlinger @jonmorosi @FOXSports @FS1 But he's certainly been the 1st or 2nd best player in the NL overall, Harper and Kershaw better.
Harper doesn't want to see you leave unless you're stretchered off. #brutal  https://t.co/EKEi9TOC4A
@RedPorchReport Harper putting up historic numbers. Thus far it's been a series to forget at the plate, but, again, he didn't pitch the 7th.
@SBNationMLB @SBNation The idea that the Mets would have walked Harper if it was 1st/2nd no outs in lunacy.
@EvanLSolomon Harper gets first chance, most seats won get 2nd chance. Easy. Harper does not play well with others, ask Danny Williams.
@ian_wayne @P_Wog   Keep focus on Harper&amp; all these good things will be added unto you May the best man who wins the heart of Canadians
@Bootyclapthundr Force out at 2nd was the first out, then the walk to Harper, then DP.  Yea terrible managing.
@albertarabbit journey to ISIS. Harper is a dangerous man. For all our sake I hope he goes. Ours is early Nov but I can vote during ++
I wonder if this kind of heckling will happen tomorrow when Harper holds events in #PEI? What say you, Islanders? https://t.co/NFmWtWuNJh
Does anyone know where Harper will be appearing tomorrow on #PEI?  #Charlottetown?  #Summerside? The coward is keeping it secret again.
Oct 19: Election day; also Harper's last day at work. #elxn42 #cdnpoli  https://t.co/JoscKroiyM
@HalfStreetHeart the "Harper doesn't hustle" narrative was born, and will endure, b/c of one dumb decision Matty's 1st month on the job

Is Hillary starting her campaign over again, for the 3rd time?
@slone people are no longer in the dark, SM has changed the political landscape forever! Hillary can't hide anymore http://t.co/ZKN62jA6nI
@DebndanfarrDeb serious Hillary moment for me, I am just noticing @realDonaldTrump chair for the 1st time in this one.
If Hillary's server really is "wiped," it may be the 1st thing the woman has ever done right. #tcot #ReadyForHillary http://t.co/HUoqKTYZU9
Hillary's campaign now reset for the 4th time. Adding humor and heart to a person that has #neither #sadtrombone
Hillary my love @HillaryClinton . don't be down because you're in 2nd place behind Bernie okay. I believe in you.
Note to the 3 women who blocked me when I said Hillary was boring and Bernie would be soaring. You may follow me again. Oops, I blocked you.
Sounds like the intro to a new sitcom.  BTW, this is campaign launch number what for Hillary? https://t.co/JFVtBCbE7L
tomorrow morning 9:30am Advanced core and sculpt with Hillary!  Although it says advanced, all levels are welcome!
@danielvankirk awesome thanks. Gina listen to the one with Hillary for like the 5th time. Luv it.
Keep in mind, Hillary's initial refusal to apologize wasn't off the cuff. It came after months of scrutiny. https://t.co/GiraU5N5Fh
@CBSNews @LGBT_Activist WOW!!  our only way for chg, VOTEIf for no other reason do u want Hillary or Donald to pick, what may b 2 SCOTUS?
@BRADSPORTS @jaketapper The news is bad for her. Ergo, it may not be presented as the most happy thing for Hillary.
In this, the 4th roll out of the Hillary campaign, SPONTANEITY is the operative word !!
Hillary is the Washington establishment, say whatever it takes to get elected. We need a change up... It may not be me but elect someone
Hillary: That was a mistake. I'm sorry about that." @EricBoehlert @mmfa going to need a complete script rewrite. http://t.co/PZ9puhBOqy
@IbadPoulette Remember how NYT aided Bush's March to Iraq War?  They need to be truthful &amp; they haven't with Hillary.
But on Friday she REFUSED to apologize in interview with liberal Hack Andrea Mitchell. Hillary is a phony. @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton
If you're bored, Ask Siri, "Hillary sucks big green donkey dicks" prepare to laugh like you were in 8th grade!!
Bernie Sanders is about to torpedo any chance Hillary might have of winning the White House going 3rd party. lmao http://t.co/8ZJnDa2Iur
U know Hillary is panicking when Chelsea Clinton will be speaking at the Amy Schumer show in Boston this Friday.
This may or may not be true but it doesn't change the fact that Hillary violated the law
Hillary may even come up with more spontaneous email humor ----&gt; Hillary Clinton's 5 funniest emails http://t.co/fTl7727lAX
Hillary gets emotional over talking about her mother -  tomorrow #MorningJoe will call her a fake. @ABC
@tbridis this why people don't believe anything Hillary say this person will soon take the 5th
@pbt3 @timthejarhead @SpringSteps That way he will testify, otherwise he's said he will plead the 5th. This is finally a way to sink Hillary
@ABCPolitics @ABC @DavidMuir OMGosh! HIllary still using her deceased Mom as a PROP to save herself from her own lies. ~May she RIP.
@ianbremmer @Eagle_Vision I'm sure Hillary kept a copy of all the original emails somewhere. Where is the 5th thumb-drive Hillary?
LOLing at Hillary apology...1st she said all of us were "confused" (a nice way of saying "stupid); now she apologizes 4 using server. #greta
@Patrick_Fogerty @SarahPalinUSA Sarah Palin, other women you disagree with may still be quite bright.Hillary may be intelligent, just wrong.
Hillary apologizes the way Kardashians wed--several times in quick succession &amp; never sincerely.
To look less guilty Hillary requests staffers to not plead the 5th,but use 2nd &amp; 3rd together. By: @weknowwhatsbest  https://t.co/8Spn6b7CP1
I love watching Hillary dance. I think she's doing the Lewinsky with that right hand  https://t.co/5ZhN7gHtZD
@HillaryClinton @TheFix @TheEllenShow Hillary has got 2 get it together by #October cuz U know whomever d Repub's nominee #Readyfortheshow!!
Hillary looks as comfortable dancing with a child as she is coming out of the closet. https://t.co/A1JRg9Ac89

I admire Hillary &amp; may even vote for her. But she so doesn't sound sorry. #email server
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Trump cant beat Hillary that is confirmed take it from me but hillary may not get nominated
@SameBackwards it may sound great. Plus Hillary will work awesome with congress and promote equality worldwide.
Hillary: So all I have to do is have an unsecured server with national secrets on it, and I'll win? Cooooool!!! https://t.co/E3rS53QMbz
Hillary will not make history as 1st female Pres. She'll make history by being 1st Pres candidate to be indicted on criminal charges.
@davidrook Or Hillary or Sanders.  We may have to rethink this whole democracy thing if someone does not step up after the pre-season. :D
@BlissTabitha So I guess dropping in on the Kardashians was just her 1st gig? The "New/Fresh" Hillary primed for reality TV Generation!
You may not have seen, but the left loves their liars, cheats &amp; traitors. Hillary is their perfect candidate! https://t.co/rP2z1upkwM
The republicans ask a sketchy candidate to pledge to the party and its ideas, Hillary demands loyalty from anyone who may like her.
Trump will take 10% of the electoral from Jeb, putting Hillary in the White House. Then she will put Trump in her cabinet. Heard it here 1st

Hillary just may be that stupid, look at some of her track record screw ups. History tells it all. https://t.co/nzgqhXONTl
@KevinInABQ Also, Hillary may begin to give the perception that perhaps she may tend to allow herself to be portrayed as less than accurate.
@FoxNews @MarkSteynOnline @weshep11 ahhh so it's Hillary's 1st characteristic Steyn cited that must have attracted Bill
Hillary cares only about Hillary. I choose to wait for a credible female to become our 1st woman president. Smart women aren't desperate!
@foxandfriends  Hillary is sorry now that she may be facing criminal charges for what they found in her email
Sarurday Pat Caddell demanded Hillary face tough questions and male interviewers; Tuesday she talks with gay Ken doll David Muir and cries
Remember Hillary denied a server existed  ever day ! A liar for President  like Obama this Country will not survive  https://t.co/qfrjOXgSBz
@RealJamesWoods I hear that Hillary's Authenticity Czar is going on the Sunday shows.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika Hillary said that on Sunday, to Andrea Mitchell what are you on a time delay?
Wait. People claim Hillary is showing her humanity because she chokes up talking about her dead mother? That may be the lowest bar ever.
Did anyone see Hillary's Server Boy actually plead the 5th or did his Lawyers only do this in the media? @TGowdySC @greta @zerohedge
Hillary says.. "I understand that you may have more questions, &amp; I am going to work to keep answering them." ..huh? work to keep answering?
I believe we may have a major security scandal with prominent people involved in the unclassified Hillary server. Is there a cover up ?
Hillary can take her phony apology and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. She is only sorry she was caught it's all about power.
@RonJohnsonWI is trying to cut the legs off @TGowdySC investigation.   Hillary's Server Boy DID NOT take the 5th under oath!

Meek drooped like a Jay-z album the 2nd &amp; 3rd time you hear it. You will understand it and Fall in love with it
Jay-Z stole his whole 2nd verse from "99 Problems" from Bun B in the UGK song "Touched". Come on y'all listen to old hip hop.
1st it was "Jay-Z's" Tidal now it's Jay Z is trying to part ways with Tidal!! He need @DashDamon to help him with These Investments
I was in like the 4th, 5th, 6th grade burning CDs and mixtapes that faithfully consisted of Dipset, old Bone Thugs, and hella Jay-Z

If you pine for a time when Jay-Z didn't suck, then listen to Czarface. Esoteric, 1/3rd of the group, is a dead ringer for his voice.
August 5th is Work Like a Dog Day. Because sometimes you just have to do what you have to do. Jay-Z said it well: can't knock the hustle!...
Imagine if Ether had dropped in the social media age. We may not have the same respect we do for Jay-z today.

Personally handing Jay-Z jerseys may be the highlight of my New York existence. First time I've been star struck.
From now on I'll try to be more sympathetic towards Freemasons like Jay-Z. When you come from nothing European culture may look like heaven.
Jay-Z and Beyonce came to Taylor's 25th but not Kim and Kanye's wedding. Imma let Taylor finish, but she had the best birthday of all time.

Who Belong In the 3rd spot for top 3 of all time. Jay-Z, Nas or Eminem?

Jay-Z make time for Bey.. The President make time for the 1st lady. So where are you so busy at again?
Song Cry x Jay-Z is one of my favorite songs, don't screw over the one that's been dsd1 no matter what changes life may bring, just don't.
When you realize classes start the 9th so the AC/DC concert will be the best concert since Eminem and Jay-Z #thatwasgoat

@BrittDTaylor the 2nd one makes me feel like I'm touring the home of a Jay-Z impersonator

If Kanye became President, folk that wrote off the masonic/illuminati symbols in he and Jay-Z's music/vids as meaningless, may think again!
Jay-Z may have his big companies... And Beyonce but that doesn't amount  to what Nas has done for the world and the people.
Today during 6th it was dead silent in the library &amp; all of a sudden my iPad started blasting Jay-Z's voice saying "Motherfucker I got this"
Also the correct Top 5 is Eminem, Jay-Z, 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., and Ice Cube in that order with Big Pun as the 6th man
Beyonce is 33 and jay-z is 45. So i ain't even stressing anymore. Bae is probably chilling in the 5th grade playing freeze tag.

Lucian Favre having 2nd thoughts about Gladbach qualifying for the Champions League - Juventus, Man City and Sevilla. Group Of Death.
City will come 3rd in that group. Sevilla will top it, Juventus runners up
Best Jerseys this season (not in order, can't choose the best) Juventus (Away) Madrid (3rd kit) Bayern (Home)
@ManCityMEN Juventus on the 15th? that's my birthday night sorted!
Sunday:  Sevilla v A. Madrid Roma v Juventus #MUFC v #Swans Monaco v PSG  Please don't disturb, i'll be watching football all day.
@manneredguy @BallHogba @j85royals Like Juventus is big. But really thought one of the big 3 may have made a play with a loan
Very interesting UCL group stage draw. #AFC should qualify 2nd at the very least. Lovely draw for Man Utd and Juventus!! :D
@CoolFMNigeria @manipulator77 @MercyAjisafe @AjukaRosemary Man city, the group is tricky, Juventus to top, Sevilla n city will fight for 2nd
Chelsea will pursue the signing of Paul Pogba from Juventus until the transfer window closes on Tuesday. (Source: Independent)
Group D looks pretty intense with Borussia Mon, Juventus, Man City &amp; Sevilla!
Man City up against Juventus and Sevilla in the #ChampionsLeague - do you think they have a chance? @MCFC http://t.co/PeHQbX17k5
MADRID, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Sevilla have completed the signing of forward Fernando Llorente from Juventus and the 30-year-old former Spain
No sign of Pogba in the official Juventus clubstore. (3rd kit promotion) http://t.co/uROk8jEtlb
Juventus have sign Cuadrado and presenting him like its the 2nd coming of Del Piero. Why? :O
@Bielsa_1899 @DiMarzio i think it's impossible. Juventus has just sold Llorente, so Zaza is needed as 4th or 5th striker on the bench.
Well Rome is rather beautiful! Can't wait to the Roma - Juventus game on Sunday! http://t.co/9OsshdZwX0
87 years of Italian Serie A history produced a first for Juventus on Sunday: they lost at home on the opening day of the season
Juventus and Schalke might reach an agreement soon, but it will most likely not be before tomorrow. Intermediaries are still negotiating.
Juventus could close the deal for Draxler tonight or tomorrow. Juve &amp; Schalke will now talk about the method of payment. [Di Marzio]
@aguero_manoj16 @sameer_mcfc @zirelhomz @Rattlethatlock yep, UCL clash with Juventus too on 15th Sep. I wish Agueroooooo's hat-trick today.
Juventus will lose to Roma on Sunday and will lift the Scudetto come end of the season.
No Pogba can't go to Chelsea he needs to wait at Juventus when his time comes he should go to Barca or RM https://t.co/laabXokDsM

Juventus! "@SerieAlive: Roma v Juventus kickoff #SerieA Sunday. Who do you love?"
Wolfsburg are on fire today! Today they may be announcing the signing of Draxler, Praet who was also linked with Juventus and Dante!
Juventus may get Draxler soon.Asking 4 Oscar won't make any sense. Ramires pace wil add up for dem @Chelsea_NGR  https://t.co/xdgvxemP7b
@mast84 how much more? (to be clear I hate Juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. They may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly

Kingsley Coman will have played for PSG, Juventus and Bayern by the time he is 20 but may not have made his international debut. Some feat.
The club denied on Saturday that Juventus had made an offer. Heldt: Because no offer had been made at the time of the statement.
Consult a Dr. If you will watch the 2nd half of Swansea vs ManUtd over Roma vs Juventus match @ 7:00

As things stand, the bottom 3 in Serie A are Bologna (18th), Empoli (19th); and Juventus (20th).
This is very bad for Juventus. Lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss Pirlo, Tevez &amp; Vidal already :(
Juventus hopeless without their 3 key players and a poor transfer window. Hope the cunts end up 5th in the league.
Roma with an early season statement while Juventus go to 0 points off 2 matches.  https://t.co/gKDtwQSFVF
For the 1st time in Serie A history, Juventus has lost their opening 2 games. Roma 2-1 Juventus -Dr.Cfc-
So with matches still to play in the round, the Giallorossi move to 2nd, almost certain to drop a few places. Falling to 18th are Juventus!
Digne and Falque caused Juventus real problems down their left in the 1st half. #ASRoma #Juventus
Our performance was unreal today man, beating Juventus 2-1 on the 2nd game of the season is a massive motivational boost for the team.

Roma (@ASRomaEN) defeat Juventus (@juventusfcen) 2-1 and gives them their 2nd straight loss of the season.

Magic Mike XXL is better than the 1st. I learned a lot about the male stripper psyche &amp; culture (&amp; midlife crisis), &amp; female sexual desire.
Yes, Magic Mike XXL is a feminist movie, but the reason may surprise you http://t.co/3r5JTNDLMa
A FB friend of mine just posted that seeing Magic Mike XXL was the best night of her life. If only she knew what my typical sat night is.
What is this force that compels me to keep watching Magic Mike XXL? Saw it the 2nd time yesterday and am already ready to see it again.
Also, ace time with the uni ladies. Saturday in Stonehaven, barbeque, Magic Mike XXL, tons of food... hips hurt from all the walking though!
Mama: Shoti, i bought 2 tickets to a movie, the title is MAGIC MIKE XXL i don't know why is that the but watch it with me tomorrow. Me:.....

But Messi made the former premier league champions look like a group of 11 lads at goals  https://t.co/fAPDWwbX0d
International Break Recap: Neymar, Messi, Rafinha score on Tuesday: Tuesday night was a good one for the Barcelona internationals tha...
Messi and Barcelona will resume La Liga action with a traditionally tricky trip to Real Sociedad (Sunday, kick-off 21:00 CET)
Top 3 players in the world? Has to be: Suarez/Ronaldo/Messi.  Only reason Messi is 3rd is because he's not proven in EPL. La liga is poor
You may dislike either Messi or Ronaldo, but you can't dislike Zlatan.
May as well scribble out the 5 on the FIFA 15 disc and replace it with a 6. Basically identical bar Bale's hair &amp; Messi's tattoo. Shambles.

thinking about the number of people who may have discovered The Cure through Ant-Man makes me SO HAPPY
why pack for moving to college tomorrow when you can watch three different trailers for Ant-man instead
@Amirosie I finally saw Ant-Man on Tuesday it was so good &amp; entertaining also I enjoyed the Spider-Man reference
@EvangelineLilly So I'm a bit late but I watched Ant-man. It was amazing and great job! Can't wait for the 2nd one!
"Ant-Man was brilliant. Inside Out was spectacular. What a great year for movies so far. Loved today, just sat in the cinema!"
"Back to work tomorrow so off to the cinema to finally watch Ant-Man with Jackson. Heard good things, plus it's Marvel... It's gonna be mega!"
"Get paid on Friday and all I can think about wanting to do is go to the cinema to watch Ant-Man, too many good looking films coming out"
Going to go see Ant-Man on Monday morning. I have the best life.
I watched Ant-Man for the 3rd time today.
"I'm desperate enough to go see Ant-Man, but it won't be out until August 12 here."

"@CSNGiants no more Bad Blood by Taylor Swift music please, the video on Monday was more like badluck!!! #badeditor #SFGiants #cheesymusic"
@castlescrumbln A response to Bad Blood may make the album ugly.
Bad Blood is not a music video it looks like a Pepsi super bowl commercial. It's 5 minutes of cameos to a song with 6th grade lyrics
Bad Blood may have the absolute worst lyricism I've ever heard in my life (regarding Taylors parts) #UsedtobeMadLove #ReallyDeepCut
Discussing the T Swift vs K Perry feud with boyf (he was unaware). He's a big fan of both. He says he's torn. May have to boycott Bad Blood.
If it were Blank Space up for 7 awards tomorrow Taylor would sweep but since it's Bad Blood she'll probably only win 5/10
"It's kinda awful when you can relate to that ""Bad Blood"" song. Bc it's my life Monday thru Thursday. I did NOTHING! And if I did tell me!"
"Just gonna say it: The lyrics in ""Bad Blood"" sound like they were written by a 7th grader. ""Done"" doesn't have two syllables, Taylor."

"Taylor Swift's song ""Bad Blood"" may be the most annoying song that's currently playing on the radio #TooRepetitive"
Bad Blood is such a terrible fucking song. I just listened to it for the 1st time and I feel like God took a shit in my ears
I like Taylor Swift as much as the next man but Bad Blood may be the single worst song ever created in the history of mankind.
"Nieces were play Taylor Swift...I submit that ""Bad Blood"" may be the worst lyrical train wreck in music history. Just abysmal shit. #Duh-un?"

"@KellyTilghmanGC  After the 2nd round, you did your usual melodramatic spew that Dustin Johnson was in a class of his own. Same old garbage."
After 75 today maybe I was wrong about Dustin Johnson getting over US Open collapse. Terrible 3rd RD #OpenChampionship
"Also, I see Dustin Johnson is leading after the 1st round of a major again. So he's gonna choke on the weekend again? #boring"
Apparently it's not just the final round that makes Dustin Johnson choke it's just Sunday.
Are we taking bets on when Dustin Johnson has a meltdown at the PGA? Saturday? Sunday? #DustinJohnson #PGAChampionship #choke
Can you bet on Dustin Johnson to be top five all week until Sunday when he comes 6th and below? I'd take that...
Did anyone tell Dustin Johnson that winning requires a lead on the 4th day and not just the 1st day?

Dustin Johnson off to a flyer yet again! All he needs to do is stay off the coke on Saturday night.
"Dustin Johnson shot the 2nd worst round of anybody in the field on a day where literally almost every player was under par, just awful"
Just pulled a Dustin Johnson on the 18th at Castle Creek and don't know if I've ever been this depressed
"Just your typical Sunday ...Spieth and Day there in the end, while Dustin Johnson falls apart in his final round"
Looking at today's play at the #OpenChampionship You can't define Dustin Johnson's round as anything other than a choke. Tied for 2nd worst
Looks like Dustin Johnson won't be winning the pga championship after shooting an 8 on the 1st hole. #choke#PGAChampionship

Well Dustin Johnson seems to have the anvil back in his bag on a Major Sunday. Dropped 20 spots on first hole. #SnowMan
"Well, Dustin Johnson isn't really in contention but that won't stop him from royally screwing things up on the Sunday of a major."
Whether it's the 3rd round or 4th round Dustin Johnson just doesn't like Sunday's in majors!!

Dustin Johnson straight dominating the majors on Thursday and Friday and folding on the weekend. #boogersugarftw
"Dustin Johnson sure knows how to get an early lead on Thursday, he just can't hang on to that lead on Sunday"
Dustin Johnson took advantage of favorable morning conditions to take an early lead at the US PGA Championship Thursday while Tiger Woods
"Dustin Johnson was in the final group Sunday, shot 75, and today he and Jim Furyk are paired 12 games before the final group @TheOpen."
Dustin Johnson will be awesome until he needs a 2ft putt on the 72nd hole come Sunday. Folds like a lawn chair under pressure. #PGA
Dustin Johnson with a snowman (8) on the first already.. Hes starting his usual Sunday form early!! He loves snowmen and sneachta!!
Dustin Johnson would be the greatest golfer in the world right now if he could play the weekend like Thursday and Friday in majors

I like Dustin Johnson a LOT but I have no confidence in him closing out a major ---unfortunately he probably won't get a chance tomorrow
I see 'Sunday Major Dustin Johnson' showed up today. +4 after the first... #roughstart #fightback #PGAChamp
I swear Dustin Johnson is winning at the end of the 1st-3rd rounds of every golf major
"If Dustin Johnson makes par at the 1st instead of quad, we have a ball game. He's still fun to watch"
If the PGA tour just played Thursday Friday Saturday. Dustin Johnson would win every tournament
"If you could win a golf tournament on the 1st day, then Dustin Johnson would have 9 majors by now."
Is Dustin Johnson the best 1st round player of all time? @ksalvo21
Is the 12th playing down wind?  Because Dustin Johnson just hit a pitching wedge 150 yards.
"It may not be Sunday, but Dustin Johnson is still getting last round jitters. He's started with four bogeys! #DeutscheBankChampionship"

"Just saw live scores amazing effort from Dustin Johnson to be back in 1st place, not surprising  Tiger with a 75"
Kudos to Dustin Johnson for finishing with a 69 after starting the day with a quadruple bogey. An 8 on the 1st could've led to an 80+ easy.
Man if this guy could just do this on a Sunday. Dustin Johnson can just obliterate a golf course when he's on. Better make it 8000 yards.
Next time Dustin Johnson tees off on a Sunday in contention in a Major want him decked out in Godolphin blue #uspga
No surprise: Dustin Johnson had a strong 1st rd Thursday at PGA Championship. Can he sustain it through weekend? http://t.co/goOqMTpsuy

"Of all the things I'm envious of when it comes to professional golfers, Dustin Johnson's strut walk may be at the top of the list."
Quality start for Dustin Johnson with an 8. He apparently is not a fan of Sunday golf. #PGAChampionship
Really hope Dustin Johnson pulls it out the bag tomorrow and ties up #TheOpen  #Adidas #AdidasGolf
Some round from Dustin Johnson considering he started with an 8 on the 1st. Another case of what might've been for him at Whistling Straits.
THIS OFFER ENDS TOMORROW!   Get Dustin Johnson to finish in the TOP 5 at 3/1 or Jordan Spieth at 5/1 when you join: http://t.co/q7W6jsOxvo
"The 10th hole seems to be a good birdie hole. Dustin Johnson birdies the 10th, his 1st hole to move to -1 #PGAChamp"
"The winner of the #PGAChampionship  will come from Thursday's 9:05 tee time (Jason Day, Dustin Johnson &amp; Rickie Fowler)   #Prediction #Golf"
Things you can always count on on Thursday of a major:  Dustin Johnson leading; Tiger Woods over par.

Had a horrible day at work so I'm in the bath listening to Frank Ocean... what do you mean it's only Monday?
"Have y'all ever just sat and listened to Frank Ocean's ""Crack Rock""? The shit is mad deep."
"Hell same with frank ocean, jhene aiko (thanks bre for putting my down 6th grade), and mf Tori Kelly...I remember her YouTube days lmao"
"Hope I wake up tomorrow to some news about @CHVRCHES Glasgow date, or to frank ocean's new album. Not too much to ask is it?"
I can't believe I'm going to see Frank Ocean this Saturday yasss
I fear the Internet may end the day Frank Ocean finally up &amp; releases this album
I had a dream last night Frank Ocean said November. Maybe this is it. #CampFlogGnaw
"I hope I never forget about Frank Ocean's verse on ""Sunday"""
I just listened to Strawberry Swing by Frank Ocean 6 times in a row and I'm working on a 7th

"I think Frank Ocean should release  on November, he's music is great for the summer. @FerreroRocherII @XabisoMkala @Nzame_M"
I think I've listened to the same frank ocean song at least 50 times today ..and I will listen 50 more times tomorrow
I think if I wake up one day and realize that I am not married to Frank Ocean I may lose my mind.
"I think we all might have to accept that there may never be another Frank Ocean album.  I'm not going to accept it, but we all might have to"
"I was about to tweet ""I'm going to fight Frank Ocean for trolling us with an old mixtape"" but then I remembered his verse on Sunday"
I'm glad I've already seen Frank Ocean live because he may never perform again at this rate.
"I'm gonna be blessed with the 5th album, justin, zayn, frank ocean (when he rises from death), adele.. I'm not stressed"
I'm laying in the sun listening to Frank Ocean and I have Hot Cheetos I'm so good right now
If Frank Ocean's next album is as good as the 2nd half of Pyramids then it's going to be a instant classic
"If Kanye, Frank Ocean, and Drake all drop albums on the same day, the Internet may never recover."
"If we have a chance to make vocal track with the International singer, that person will be Frank Ocean. Happy Friday everyone ! #DreamBig"
"Im sitting in my car listening to Frank Ocean, thinking about what could have been in life. How's your Monday?"
It's August 11th.  Have we all forgotten about the Frank Ocean record?
It's crazy how I listened to Frank Ocean again for the first time since 9th grade &amp; it's like I time skipped from 9th grade to now wtf

So Ice Cube can give us Ride Along 2 but he can't give us another Friday movie with Chris Tucker.

Guys can we kill the John Cena meme please. I see enough of him on Monday nights.
I used to love John Cena until it started being reported that he was politicking Nikki's push. It seems obvious. https://t.co/nxJneCrxB8

man tomorrow if my parents surprise me with justin bieber tickets I'll have a heart attack
"#mufc really need to sort their shit out! No defenders &amp; attackers! Stones &amp; berahino or Kane, may not be the best yet but would take them"
"1st they're trying Kane &amp; now Derrick Rose. Yeah, OK. I call bullshit. Lie detector tests should be mandatory when it comes to rape charges."
2nd season epl syndrome would have been worse on kane if he left spurs. Let him suffer it there then improve later
"@Aviator973 @ByTimGraham Agree with 1st point, and I can't stand Kane or Blackhaws. I detest slander."

"@PuckinHostile @GradHawksBlog @ChiSox_History as sick as it may sound, I hope Kane gets the indefinite suspension and Hawks get cap relief"
"@SebSB @SBerahino I really hope he stays now, Even if Kane dies of exhaustion by November"
@SpursOfficial @rapharris_ tomorrow better be a busy day or expect Kane to be fucked half way through.
"@WinslowHorne @broach93 1. Agree, that dude is fast. 2. Wat. 3. Friday's. 4. Should've sold Kane when he was worth anything"
@_socoamaretto If Kane doesn't find his Nov-Mar form again I think they could be in for a very bad season. Dier-Mason is the kind of...
"@guyfarmer1978 lol, true. The other striker you do have were trying to take off your hands by Tuesday, lol!! Kane has lost his confidence!"
"@ironviews Good article, and good point about Sakho. He could be sat here now in the same situation as Kane, with people starting to doubt."
"Didn't it take Kane until, like, November to score his first PL goal last season?"
"Hawks might have had decision made for them. With Kane case going before grand jury, no way he can be in camp on the 17th, IMO. #NHL"
I am hearing a settlement may be in the works with Kane and alleged victim. He might be pulling a Kobe - WHICH MEANS HE IS GUILTY!!
I've been thinking about it... Does anyone else find it disturbing how Kane may face rape charges and GM's are calling on his availability?
Kane might just be going thru that 2nd season syndrome
"No way Kane comes here, it's where he gets in trouble the most. Would be kicked out of the NHL by his 30th bday for summer incidents"
"Real shit vote Kanye for president if he really is doing it , can't stand Donald trump and Kane's my 2nd dad"
Same old same old good till the last 3rd no support for Kane no width fuck knows what Poch is doing ain't got a fucking clue
"Spurs may aswell make use of adebayor,there paying him millions and there guna need someone when they realise Kane is a one season wonder"
"Toews backing Kane &amp; Voynov arrested by Immigration in US. Oh, tomorrow is going to be an icky NHL news/comment day."
Too early to sentence Kane.. he is actually shit but u nid 2 gv him time 2 shw up .. eben ladt year he got his 1st epl goals quite late
"Would never vote for Kane for president, mostly with Kim Kardashian as his wife. No way in hell is she going to be the 1st lady"
"and FYI, I never had a HUGE problem with Kane; I just don't have respect for anyone who may of raped someone."
@KingOBlackheath Kane and Rooney last night.....may have been the ugliest strike partnership of all time. Horrifying
Kane may have raped a woman &amp; the 1st thought teams have is about trading for him? Fucked up. http://t.co/4mB4QYQKKU http://t.co/i1uXbk36y7

"1st Giroud, now Kane, lol what a funny day #TOTEVE #Spurs #Everton"
5 teams contact the Blackhawks about Kane... they dont seem to care they may lose him if he's charged ... winning that important to teams?
@AaronTHFC he will have to obviously otherwise just Kane for season. January won't be anybody for sale. Clubs don't need to sell.
"@AdamOsper @tonyfowler4  Yes, I'm optimistic but feel we really needed a 2nd striker who could either play alone or link with Kane"
@AdamOsper think you're mad. 6th is only possible if Kane repeats last years feat which is next to impossible
@AndrewGreif Concern's having 5th guy who can play CB; Kane's natural Safety but he played some CB in camp unless others like Tyree will 2/2
@Atomic_Moog @nick_elt @djc8008 swapping Kane for Giroud week 4. Hazard is a waste of coin as well so he may go next &amp; bring in Yaya or Kun
"@BBCMOTD Kane should stop chasing da' goal, stay calm goals will come automatic, may be he'll get a hatick next game who knows"
"@BenSonicz Yea,i still rmmbr what Kane said, word for word,he was on stage he said 'AUSTIN,THIS SUNDAY THE BLOOD ON YOU WILL BE FOR REAL"""
@BenjButton87 @scullytony @Poblfc @johns3boys @IBRWT just hearing Kane scored for England off to Spain tomorrow it's great to be alive#dubs
@BespokeDave MENTAL. The goals will be 2nd half when the subs come on. Kane will bag a couple I reckon.
@Bull_Diggy @WestHamMatters Toxic deserve 16th place and a season of turmoil in the boardroom plus Kane's struggles on the pitch #happydays
"@CallumHaymes lamela was shite on Saturday and as for Kane it's no goals in 3, he scored final day of season against Everton remember"
@CobesME4 we'll see when he scores the winner against you and is off to Man Utd with Kane in January. Enjoy Adebyor x
@Corrienationstr dunno. Ibra may not leave. Hes almost 34. Kane mayb but he looks off. Eithier a one season wonder or his head is turned
@Corrienationstr kane is a better then rooney with back to goal. rooney better sat just off
@EddyDavis19 and yeah I agree berahino may go on to be massive but with Kane at the club I'd focus on devolving him even more!
"@EricWSoccer Yeah. In the case of England, when (I live in hope) they have Rooney, Sturridge, Kane and Welbeck fit they may be forced to"
@GaffneyVLC Use Ade in Europa and Cups and let his contract run down. Best way to do it. Save Kane for league and get Berahino as 2nd ST
@Gentleman_THFC Bang him up front with Kane and play Sun and N'Jie on the wings then surely!
@GrimsToyShow grim did you know that Kane will return on Monday night raw
@HannahEckardt This is like my 3rd msg about this but im dumb. Do you know kane's # anymore? i lost it. Also hope everythings good and stuff
"@Hostile_Derek @2ndCityHockey I don't know enough to say for sure, but he may make us not miss saad (if Kane isn't in prison)"
@Iam_Stonewall I'm sure it's going to be Sting. Expecting a Brothers of Destruction reunion too Sunday with Kane helping Taker in his match.
@IdMjones Jesus. I CREATED? I said Kane may not reach the same heights. You then sent me 3 tweets asking my views on Martial in an attempt
@ImperialDesi Hawks will discipline Kane for sure. But he'll play again for the Hawks. May just have to wait a bit
"@JGoldLabel Doubt it. Rumor has it Kane may attack Lesnae because Lesnar ""Put him out"" Sting shows up sets up Taker vs Sting Mania 32"
@JJPhyall @realBenReid I wouldn't be surprised with kane with sting possibly tomorrow
@JW_Burton Kane should of scored and would of made it easy then. Still hope always the important goal is the 1st mate. plenty of time
@Jason_Aldean  Kane just had his 6th heart surgery 4 wks ago-now he's home jamming! http://t.co/pfdzlQOx3R http://t.co/oyazi8VUdl
@JayAndreas @AnglesOfSupport @Sebby_Williams @CoachCKane I can call the lady cause Kane won't turn up till Thursday
"@Kaneshow oh no Kane are you getting a divorce? I just listened to the replay of Tuesday's show and you said ""bc of the divorce"" WHHHAAAT?"
"@Keith_Russell @bensmith130 Both young, talented with potential. Kane's 1st season was ace, struggled since. Martial still raw.risks in both"
"@Keith_Russell Kane. Still remember the deadline day swoop for Berba. Something similar to happen on Tuesday, maybe?"
@LeeCater94 he's a has been. One season wonder like Kane. He'll be gone come the end of the season when Chelsea finish 6th again.
"@Lord_Sugar he will see him only to sign a cheque for me Pogba and Stones!.......careful, we may come for Kane as well"
"@LukeBBurgess not true. Kanes sitter, mason had 2 great chances and kane had another in the 2nd!"
@MBTA happened a few minutes ago.. I believe the bus route was 49... If he went into other Kane's he may have hit firefighters
@MUFC_Hub buys and will make it easier for Kane to get goals not Top 4 contenders for me but 6th
@Mellealaw @ScottLevinWGRZ @sportsmockery @WGRZ Maybe she did.  She may not like being blamed for the accuser going to Kane's house.
@MoreMorley @sonyakennedy yeah but then again Kane has respect for Abby and still butts heads with her so it may happen
@MrsimonWilson1 Will text you the changes tomorrow who do you want to change Kane will check on Bertrand fitness
@Potters_1863 @APB1979 I definitely watch a different game than you. England 2nd best 1st half and not that good 2nd half Kane is difference
"@RedPawRelief Kane, a dog in your care back in July, was found loose today in G-town. Can you help us locate the owner?"
"@RenoWallabout @juicysushi @Inverted_FB @BenoitsSmartCar Chadli as a back up/3rd striker is not the worst thing to have. To replace Kane, no"
@Ryan_Davis17 May not have been just find it strange... That's all. I just hope the same protection that came to Kane doesn't come to Rose.
@Shem_THFC We need a 2nd Str Target-Man too. To lead when Kane is out. Or to play Kane as a #10 with him. I see a deadline day Austin bid.
@Spurs2380 Kane may well get so disillusioned with lack of signings that he slaps in a transfer request. That would be interesting!
@THFC_Spurs KANE he may be ABLE he feckin aint what a touch for a bug man #kanescomedygold
@Teekosey I'm optimistic about Son. Looks like a great finisher and to have another goal threat may open up some space for Kane
@_Jayspurs @SPURSin140 @GlobalSpur well if thats the case the Kane and Eriksen got us out of the shit last season and got us 5th not Poch
"@_Meredinho I just worry he could go either way 50/50,pretty much like Kane,hoping he has a most important 2nd season,need finished article"
"@andygoldstein05 I'll go Kane in......one of Mata, Fellani or Young going the other way. 2nd Benzema for DDG........warm or freezing? Neymar"
@arby_18 @NHL_Campbell remember that day Chevy traded Bogo and Kane... Wonder if history could repeat itself. A 2nd p for p trade..
@benjiboodleboy and the fact you only have 10. Take it he's the missing 11th player behind Kane?
@biggersthebomb Seems to me like the Spurs gotta be careful because once Kane's contract runs out he may leave
@cartilagefree can Son and N'Jie give us what we need to supplement Kane until the January window?
"@closetothegame Kane in EDM would be insane. If Kane went to MIN, MIN may finally be able to beat CHI in the playoffs"
"@davemeasures True, but I don't think Kane wants to leave. He's young and living the dream. Why would he go to United, to come 4th not 5th?"
@dobbospurs88 I reckon Kane will get off the mark on Sat then he'll be buzzing again c
@fantasyleague @EwingCalvin Going to be at the Lane on Saturday and if he's not in the squad I'll be gutted... Kane needs help!
@hfialkov Thanks. Any credibility to Kane interest with Huberdeau as centerpiece? Or shall I just wait until tomorrow?
@hotspur423 as fans we should expect 6th and visible improvements in style. He will have to drop Kane for the cups now which is very sad.
@james_sussex tbh I also wanted to have him and Kane gain a partnership in case we need it 1-0 down and need a 2nd striker. No better game.
@juicysushi @ColinWaters @Inverted_FB @BenoitsSmartCar Kane gets hurt tomorrow. You really want Chadli/Son playing 99% of striker till May?
@julesss_x0 maybe he will let us go 3rd period to get it fixed. Or Kane's class
@leaham50 @_jaylawrence We started the window with 2 problem areas. Needing a 1st XI standard DM and a pacey ST as a Plan B/Back up to Kane.
@mank56 @TottenhamFC93 @STurner2011 if we get pace into the side and support Kane more then things may turn out ok
"@mattyd1984 Yeah would be. Think Kane will retire soon, so that may happen with those two. Still got 8 months till Mania so we'll see."
@neilashton_ you red tops are so biased towards London clubs slagging Rooney off for not scoring then say Kane should be ENG 1st choice
@nicktheyid61 he may be able to scrape by just with the midfield but if Kane has a difficult time or injury I don't see enough goals in us
@pokeefe1 totally agree. After Levy's balls up with getting Berahino we may as well have used Ade as back up to Kane
"@rocketrichman bizarre... Kane breaks a leg in training with England tomorrow, then what?"
@russjohns8 @Slinger1970 @_LAPDOG  I've gotta admit I'm not too sure yet about Kane mysen... Got a lot to live up to after that 1st season
"@ryanshoey Kane and bentaleb were always gonna breakthrough, too talented not to, Bentaleb should be 4th choice with class in front of him"
"@simonhfootball Yep, Kolarov and Wilson are two I want in for sure. May even get shot of Eriksen as Kane isn't scoring."
"@sloader300 What were Mason's 2 good chances? Kane's 2nd (was that the one creeated by Chadli, where he had 4 bodies to shoot through)?"
@spuddy1878 it's always against no doubt Kane will end his drought on Saturday
"@spursycob @realdealdanny we gambled that team would stay third all season, just like we gambled kane alone would get us through 1st games"
@spursycob That's the trouble. If they are decent &amp; Kane stays fit we may be 'ok'. If that doesn't happen then we are fucked. That simple
@stumpyspurs Man Utd may be forced to go in for Kane or even Austin if they can't lure bigger stars to the club.
"@takerman15 I never once thought, it would be Kane until the last hr. people starting it may be Kane."
@thcoast @DanIrving95 take potential out of the equation is S.B. really a downgrade from Kane? i dont think so. his pace may B better suited
"@tottenhamtalk1 Get him straight in the number 10 tomorrow night what you think? Son to Kane, Kane with the rabona pass to Son, Goal 2-0 Tot"

Credit where it's due that is a good ball by Mason but I would say the ball is made by Kane's run. He'll score 2 in the 2nd half.

@TheRomanAnoai you've listened good man your 1st tip is to eliminate all allys to seth rollins... J &amp; J / Kane / Triple H / Steph Mcmahon.
@Wonder_Spurs going by the last 3 games yes.I think son may bring last season Kane back.He under to much pressure .We expect to much of him
@adampeacock3 @TheRealBozza @RobbieSlater17 Kane's best service in the 1st half came from the keeper! Says it all
"@ahmed_muz No, don't think he's ready yet. With Kane, N'Jie, Son, Chadli &amp; Lamela we have enough options till Jan + Ade in case of emergency"
"@brewingwins ""No!"" Am I outa the loop somewhere? This is the 2nd time today I've heard Kane &amp; AZ in same breath."

@foofighters on our way to Edinburgh it's our son Kane's 21st -we brought him up on great music! Please say happy birthday.thanks guys
@gary302 agreed. Pay 30mill for Kane now or watch him bag 20+ and pay 50 mill in Jan ? The other 2 are going nowhere.
"@kanechoa Hi, Kane. We're sorry for the inconvenience. May we please have your ticket number and e-mail address via DM? Thank you."
@nurfgunjake fingers crossed you see kane tomorrow got to meet up with your boyf
@robbieJBhood Kane walked off with a tight calf last saturday. If he starts i guess N'jie will be on the bench.
@thfc53 Lol. Does he seem like a Poch type of player? Or one that would fit in our wage structure? Or play 2nd fiddle to Kane? No.
"A mong he may be, but if Kane can produce last seasons form consistently then England have a goal scorer for 10+ years"
Can't wait till 6pm tomorrow to come and the only recognised striker have is Kane for rest of season #TransferWindow #pullyourfingeroutlevy

GOAL! Kane 1-0 England   His 3rd in 4 internationals. Shaw with a great pull back and Kane slams it home with his left.   #ENGvSWI
"Good finish from Kane, may not rate him that highly but he still scores"
Great save by Howard thought Kane got his 1st of the season then tho #EFC #COYB
Harry Kane may be a noble prince but he can't score goals without his army behind him aka WHY IS KANE ALWAYS ALONE UP FRONT CMON GUYS UGH
I am really hoping the #preds aren't one of the 5 teams that called about trading for Kane. Not sure we have enough room for 3rd chances.
"I like what I saw tonight, particularly in the 2nd half. 8 up/8 down. Let's keep rolling lads (hey Roy, you play Kane always) #England"
"I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/aCZISHWQI0 Josh Mathews questions the look AJ gave Kane: Raw June 4,"

"Pat Brisson, the agent for #Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane, said Tuesday he believes Kane is innocent of any crime ( Per @ESPNChiPowers)"
Pretty sure Kane will interfere on Sunday in the Taker/Lesnar match and Taker wins then they have a rubber match and Les nar wins.
Sunday Supplement are honestly making out that Kane is one of the best strikers in the world.  He isn't even the best striker at Tottenham.
True. True. Very true. FALSE.  Go out and get some attacking help before you run Kane into the ground. #COYS  https://t.co/RVZg7rSVNk

I may never tweet about anything other than Kanye West ever again
"I may not always agree with Kanye West, but that's a guy who, if he wants something, he's going to do all that he can to get it."
"I may not speak too highly of Kanye West the person, but I am a fan of his music. It is possible to separate actions and work."
I remember in the 6th grade Dylan and I could sing every word to Kanye West's Heartless
I want Charlie Wilson and Kanye West to perform at my wedding and/or my 25th birthday party #Bound

I'm in a GroupMe where we're having an intelligent conversation about Kanye West's ankles. Happy Monday.
I'm really looking forward to adding Kanye West to our wall of presidential candidates at the office tomorrow. #VMAs
Idk why people are bashin on Kanye West. If u think about it the man really be speakin the truth. He may be an ass @ times but he's smart.
"If you hate Kanye West, just listen to Runaway. It may change your perspective on his personality."
In case anyone asks me tomorrow no I didn't see the VMA's but yes I would vote for Kanye West because of two simple reasons
In respect of Kanye west tomorrow so I will only listen to his music all day

@SmittyGotNoHoes it's the coaching fault how is Kendrick not rushing the passer anymore on 3rd down ? Like Cox not our best option
@yomilo when we make that restaurant the picture of the ruby yacht beating Kendrick shall hang on the with our 1st dollar
Both dope songs but Kendrick has a message Future just goin dumb on auto tune  https://t.co/pqIhnFhFNR
Cole clearly said him and Kendrick aren't doing anything. So whatever he's dropping in February isn't what you think.
Damn dawg you weak ass niggas are really berating Kendrick. https://t.co/svYNcP7SqN
Honestly only bad thing I can say about the Kendrick album were the roll out of singles and what ones were picked 1st
How cam called obj over to him was just as disrespectful when Kendrick called out Cole 1st and last name on control and not everybody else
I'll hate on Kendrick all fucking day but that Black Friday freestyle is fucking legendary
I'm thinking it's either some solo shit or that Kendrick collab  https://t.co/P7y253rFzw
J. Coles verse in Black Friday was kinda disappointing but Kendrick killed it
Kendrick made sure iggy wasn't going to steal his bars when he snapped on Black Friday.
Kendrick said a whole bunch of nothing on that Black Friday something but you people say e be verse of the moment.
"Kendrick the GOAT twitter ""All females hoes"" twitter  https://t.co/YXd3f1psRg"
"Kendrick's ""u"" and The Social Experiment's ""Sunday Candy"" are two songs that make my allergies act up when I hear them."
Kendrick's 2015 album may be important but it's not especially listenable. Future sounds like a guy playing with a microphone at Best Buy.
Let's be honest how many of ya sat down and listened to Kendrick's To Pimp a Butterfly? Cause I skimmed through it once and turned it off
Lmao I thought Kendrick was about to play Black Friday and I freaked out but nah

"Someone commented on Black Friday by Kendrick and Cole and wrote, ""Once I saw these niggas looking homeless I knew fire was on the way."" Lol"

While we're on the topic.... J. Cole &gt; Kendrick   As far as Black Friday is concerned... Go debate ya fat aunt who only wears elastic pants
Why can't Kendrick rap on every song like he did Black Friday. Old Kendrick is better.
Yo it's been 2 and a half weeks since Kendrick's Black Friday dropped and I still haven't fully understood all his lyrics yet...
"if you think Kendrick's Black Friday was better than J. Cole's, you can block me now"
rap mon and suga sampling swimming pools by kendrick is by far the weirdest shit i have seen
"I fucks with Kendrick, but March Madness deserve to be our national anthem it's that cold"

@devtrilla @DailyRapFacts yeah true. I say he drops in Feb. but idk... That's when j cole and Kendrick I think might drop their project...
"@dubKeks @Mr_15_ I get u, but for me, the emotion/anger in Kendrick makes him much more like Tupac. Blacker the berry, Black Friday, U, etc."
@ekat2104 Run the Jewels and Kendrick took 1 and 2. With Modest Mouse in 3rd. Bit of a genre shift there...
@esivs i put Kendrick's in 2nd. i think it belongs to cole. it was a better batch of art.
@inihelene have you heard Black Friday by Kendrick Lamar &amp; j.Cole ??
@iwmarrujo @MrGonzalezz Kendrick's 1st record is a top 10-15 album ever imo. 2nd album is when keepin it real goes wrong...

"Cole dissed Future on his Black Friday, Kendrick dissed everyone on his. the collab album bout to be one big subliminal diss."
Did we all forget about Kendrick's Black Friday track? Lawwwd
Do the Black Friday verses from Kendrick and Cole count?  https://t.co/vGdQ9RVCEu
Em is better at painting a picture with his words.and thats just my opinion..cuz ppl view Kendrick's 1st album as a story..and I don't.
FACT: if Kendrick made a song about crapping it would be 10x more influential than a Future song about slavery https://t.co/k6WXDJKkSH
Fab &amp; 50's tapes the only shit I been playing lately.. Well add cole and kendrick's Black Friday too of course

I just started busting out rapping to Kendrick's Black Friday and Sadie almost spit her water out
I know [Nicki M] was commissioned for the BBHMM remix back in June along w/ Kendrick but i have no idea what progress has been made #ANTI
"I only give Kendrick his props because of his rapping style on Black Friday, his lyrical sense is there as well but it's Cole or die for me"
I stanned Kendrick heavy Dec-Feb should I be happy about this and call everyone favs irrelevant? https://t.co/LB8mZ9F1rn
I think if Cole wanted he coulda had a better verse on Black Friday than Kendrick
Is anyone going to go see Kendrick at day for night tomorrow?!?
Is it February yet? Need the new J. Cole album (with Kendrick?).
It'll be interesting to know what content Kendrick comes up with for his 3rd album and what it's conceptual conception will be about
KENDRICK and SEAN - KEITH want to take you to a GAY BAR -  TONIGHT as we fling cocktails - SUNDAY  7 PM-2 AM... https://t.co/gTaA7czMin
Kanye west is dropping a new album and Kendrick and cole are dropping a collab album. The rest of the rap game may as well give up.
Kendrick Murdered it No disrespect J Cole wounded it https://t.co/p04GVP40fE
Kendrick always new content u don't know what to expect... Cole talk the same Shiit from 1st project on every one https://t.co/AgbUNmCxP6
"Kendrick did the same except talk about Molly, but he said we can live at the mall.. that's turnt https://t.co/HLCFn6rovb"
"Kendrick has become a lot more covert with his ""wokeness"" that most ""woke"" listeners may have felt comfortable with in his pre-TPAB music..."
Kendrick in Black Friday &gt; J Cole in it
Kendrick may have gotten all the critical acclaim... But that album ain't last past the first week from my understanding.
Kendrick sets the bar on that Black Friday shit got damn #TDE
"Kendrick's Black Friday goes so fucking hard, and over Cole's beat just makes it better."
"Kendrick's Black Friday on replay, gonna be that kind of day."
Kendrick's To Pimp a Butterfly was at 1st (2) (p)IMP (a) (c)ATERPILAR.tupac.the last track on the album ends in a conversation between the 2
"LMAO i read ""cultural evolution is Lamarckian"" and was like o shit what's that dude's name again? and the 1st thing i thought was Kendrick"
Let August &amp; Kendrick get on the same track &amp; watch the world crack!... Slowly
Like I heard so many people complain about Kendrick's flow on TPAB but loved Black Friday. When he used the same EXACT flows in that.
Listen Kendrick hard but that last Album was weak af yal can remove yal lips from his dick cause the 1st Album was wayyyyyy harder
"Me after listening to ""Black Friday"" by Kendrick for the first time https://t.co/h8Iq2uNp5Y"
My microwave wasn't working so I just played Kendrick and Coles Black Friday...
No disrespect to kendrick but march madness was the song of the year if not the greatest song of all time
"OMG. I don't know why I'm just hearing ""Black Friday"" but J.Cole murked Kendrick big time."
"Obviously Kendrick, sorry Frank ""the disappearing act"" Ocean https://t.co/kKPIno8FeW"

Only rapper out there who could really fuck with a Kendrick instrumental. Respect! https://t.co/yFdQG0knaM
"Remember when u called plies a monkey? ""Or when u agreed Kendrick was the 2nd best rapper in the game but everyone else was the first?"""
"So Drake's ""If You're Reading..."" is the 3rd best album of the year, behind Kendrick and Adele (haha). They might as well hand me the Grammy"
So what do you think about Black Friday by Kendrick
Someone said that they might snub Kendrick on all 11 nominations or he may get just 1. If that happens then it's clearly rigged.
Someone should suggest she READ some of Kendrick's LYRICS. It may be the 1st socially conscious experience she's EVER had #KathieLee
They waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
This kid put Kendrick &amp; J. Cole in his in his top 5 &amp; doesn't know about Section 80 or Friday Night Lights....... Smh at this new generation
Tomorrow The Last Day of Work then I'm Off for a Week.. Ima Walk in there Like Kendrick on the Vice City Video
"Top Grammy nominees are ...: The nominations for the 58th Grammy Awards were announced Monday morning, and Taylor Swift and Kendrick ..."
"When I hear tale of 2 citiez beat, I think it's Kendrick Lamars Black Friday..."
When niggas in the bus are playing Kendrick and Cole's Black Friday out loud &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Who going to the Kendrick lame concert tomorrow?
"Why Jason just said Cole and Kendrick dropping the album I'm February. He's like go listen to Black Friday, it's the last thing he says"
Why people think Kendrick and Cole dropping an album together feb......it prolly gone be a solo Cole album
Why the hell is Black Friday by j cole and Kendrick not on iTunes yet.
You can't even compare Kendrick and Future. Way different. Future just got fire beats. K Dot got Barzzzzz  https://t.co/ar3hfswGMK
"damn Kendrick running the rap game, Cole a close 2nd tho"
every time I hear alright by Kendrick I think it's j Cole's Black Friday
"false, no such thing as ""a song better than march madness"", Kendrick would tell you that too https://t.co/QXhckVFpk9"
lil cousin Kendrick funeral is tomorrow it will be hard seein alot of people heartbroken and crying #flyhighkendrick https://t.co/HqvTD0iCHL

"Charles Hamilton ""Black box"" is on Friday only if he was focused he would have been up there with cole and Kendrick"

I love Kendrick's 2nd album as much as anyone but it doesn't compare to Good Kid Mad City
"I love refinding amazing songs. In 9th grade( now im a junior) i loved SOO many amazing rap songs like Memories back then with Kendrick, bob"
"I may need to fact check, but I'm pretty sure that Kendrick is only the 2nd rapper to have his 1st 2 albums nominated for AOTY."
I posted on FB for the first time in years to only post links from the Black Friday songs from J.Cole and Kendrick lmao
"I purchase Kendrick, Cole, August, Lito, Drake etc. they give you records that mean something, that relate to life"
I sat in the dark for two hours and listened to kendrick
I wanna go to the kendrick concert tomorrow but thats like a death trap

I'm only just hearing Black Friday..... Kendrick u freed me
I'm pretty sad that this is the first time I've heard Black Friday by Kendrick and J.cole
I'm still not over Black Friday with Kendrick and J Cole tbh
"I'm still not over Kendrick's ""Black Friday"" freestyle. Lyrically up there with the ""Control"" verse. I said it."
"I've been listening to J Cole's and Kendrick's Black Friday.I mean even if it isn't a collaborative project, let the niggas drop some fire."
Idk how on earth I'm going to get through April 14th without Kendrick and Oscar
"If I could make the Logic and Future shows in March and a Kendrick show, I'd be content."
If Kendrick and Cole drop they're album in February watch Drake drop his a week after just to kill there buzz. That would smart marketing
If you haven't heard Black Friday by Kendrick and J Cole I suggest for you to listen to it.
"If you like rap and don't like Kendrick's ""Black Friday"", news flash: you don't really like rap"
"J.Cole &gt; Kendrick Lamar, biased opinion Kendrick is growing on me and the February album if true will be lit"

"Kendrick is reinventing the rap industry, he may be not winning as much as other rappers, but shit that music is fucking worth it. TPAB"
Kendrick killed this beat better but I see you j.cole!  https://t.co/wYv4TBHqER

"Mannn, Kendrick may be better than Future, but I would rather listen to Future am day of the week."
Maybe because of this he may compliment Kendrick if they both did a collab album &amp; might fight to hold his own might be good
"Mick Jenkins may be the best rapper alive and this is strong consideration of Kendrick,King Los,Ab-Soul,Big Sean,Vince Staples and others."
"Mj had 12, Kendrick with 11 on an album our culture didnt love at 1st, although grammys are hit &amp; miss in hip hop hes influencing people"
"Not sure how to feel about Kendrick's sons coming up. Inspiration is beautiful, but c'mon fammm."

Super-happy for Kendrick today but the reality is he'll lose 90% of those nominations in February and then it's back to hating the Grammys.
The Black Friday remixes by Kendrick and Cole are the exact reason I can't wait for their joint album
"The way J-Cole and Kendrick are teasing the world for the their collab album, with Black Friday is just faaaaya!!!"

We get a 2nd Christmas in February with Kendrick and Coles collab album
"Welp I got 3/5 right for AOTY, Kendrick deserves it but it may come down to Taylor or The Weeknd"
Why am I just now hearing J Cole and Kendrick tracks Black Friday... Both of them are fire
Why do I feel like i'm falling in love with Kendrick for a 3rd time? This is weird. The dude just seems so happy and finally at peace.
"Y'all can't keep comparing jcole &amp; Kendrick , that's like the moon &amp; the sun ..."
You can listen to Kendrick when he rap about real shid...but can't listen to august alsina when he sings bout real shid......funny

#USOpen Anderson beat Murray in the 4th round. It's Murray's earliest Grand Slam exit in 5 years
@SkySportsTennis Murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing Djokovic
@SkySportsTennis it's a joke! Troicki v young into a 5th set and on Sky go we are forced to watch Murray walking into the practice court???
@cake_sports Haven't seen it yet. Caught end of Murray loss lights and interview. SVP is that dude though. 1st show.
@maxcouch @roryjiwani @Alex_0wen @DanBarberTF @Tennisratings Murray will never win a slam again unless he changes. 2nd serve a joke
Anderson absolutely killed Murray in the 4th set tie break 7-0 to win the match. How embarrassing for Murray
Andy broken to start the 3rd set; still complaining to chair ump that 5 minutes is excessive bathroom usage time. Murray's so done. #USOpen
Beginning to worry Murray may be stuck on two grand slams for the rest of his career.
"Booo, Murray gets broke early in the 2nd set. It's not as if he's playing bad, Anderson is playing exceptional tennis here. #USOpen"
I LOVE how aggressive both Serena &amp; Venus are being off the 2nd serve return. Murray would lose this match! @cbfowler @bgtennisnation
If Murray loses this 2nd set I'm pretty sure he won't win this.
Murray about as dead as the aliens in Independence Day on July 4th in #America. They die in the movie either way but worse on the 4th. #Dead
Murray always struggles on Louis Armstrong. How pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to  lose his mini break in the 1st?
Murray been broken in the 3rd. Unreal. Straight sets loss would make my day
Murray blew it! Just couldn't handle Anderson's first serve in the 4th set.
"Murray in real trouble now, down a break in the 3rd #USOpen Looking angry and frustrated"
"Murray is beaten before the QF of a Grand Slam for the first time in five years. Anderson, magnificent throughout, took 4th set tiebreak 7-0"
Murray misses a good chance to break at the start of the 4th. Sloppy along with a brilliant shot from Anderson denies the break. #USOpen
"Murray with a splendid array of swear words at the end of the 2nd set. Sitting there with the commentator having to say, ""sorry.  sorry."""
Murray's in major crisis here - 5 - 1 down in the 2nd set after losing the 1st! scenes!!

#USOpen2015 Eeeeek! 3rd set tiebreak for Murray &amp; Anderson! Konta v Kvitova on serve with the Briton serving very well!
1 set up and has already broken Murray in the 2nd. This is beautiful from Kevin
15th seed @kevinanderson18 defeats 20th seed Thiem and he's through to the 4th round of the @usopen to play Bellucci or Murray! #USOpen
2nd break point for Murray! Will he take it?
"3 hours 40 min on the clock now for Murray, but he's still hanging in there - grimly - &amp; has levelled at 2-2 4th set after winning 3rd on TB"
3 unforced errors for Andy Murray against 17 forAnderson yet Murray chucks away the 1st set with a careless double fault in the tie break.

@kevinanderson18 2-1 up in the 4th with serve and 2-1 up in sets. Murray jumpy like his had a mustard enema.  #USOpen
@kevinanderson18 Murray will take you apart on Monday. One break of serve each set will be enough for Andy. Your return game is shit!
@kevinanderson18 breaks with absurdly angled service ret in 1st game of 3rd. Murray's mountain just got higher
@kevinanderson18 plays terrific TB &amp; wins it with big off fh winner 7-5. Murray with plenty of work to do now as sun goes down.

"ANDERSON versus MURRAY:  Anderson 1 set ahead, now 2nd set. 3games ahead. 76 31 Murray just kept his game."
"After Kevin Anderson to Murray in the 4th set, it's Roger Federer who dishes out a tiebreak bagel to Isner. 1st set RF, 7-6(0)."
"Although it's hard to tell, since I only have radio commentary. May just be that Anderson is choking badly, not Murray playing better."
And ASU tackles Murray short of the 1st down for the first time
Anderson gets tight but Murray cant take advantage. Anderson saves break points to hold &amp; takes the 2nd set 6-3!! #USOpen
"Anderson is up 2 sets, but Murray is up a break in the 3rd set. It feels even-steven right now."
Anderson now has the confidence to take rips at the Murray 2nd serve. Time to take off a few mph and up the first serve percentage Andrew
"Anderson survives a test, and now has 2 sets up on Murray. Can the Brit pull off a 2nd 0-2 set comeback?"
Anderson upsets #3 seed Murray 7-6 6-3 6-7 7-6. Reaches 1st ever major QF. South African played well going for it. Longest match at #USOpen
"Anderson with his 5th set point... And this time, he takes it. Murray will have to come from 2 sets down again. #USOpen2015 #Murray"
Anderson's 1st serve goes off in that game but Murray cant take advantage. Anderson now leads 4-1 in the 2nd set #USOpen
Another dramatic day at the #USOpen. Federer &amp; Murray march on but Bouchard suffers freak fall http://t.co/91bTp3QgXe http://t.co/Wl3Sbfm3LR
Back out on practice court -Kevin Anderson after his 4 hr18 min win over Murray to make 1st slam QF @SkySportsTennis http://t.co/VdBePMBzld
But I still remember it to this day and it carries much more weight now so S/o to Mr. Murray wherever he may be
But it's not just about overall nmbrs. Murray &amp;Mathews will put #Eagles in a lot of 3rd and manageable situations.  And finish at goal line
Camera closes in on Murray in his chair after losing 2nd set and he's dropping F bombs like they're going out of fashion. Brilliant. #USOpen
"Come on, Murray!! Anderson hitting the ball like there's no tomorrow"
"Could the #Aggies get more conservative on offense? Would be hard. Turn it over on 4th-and-1 at ASU's 20, misusing Murray for second time."
"Dammit, Murray just wont lie down. 4th set tie break now. @kevinanderson18 up 2-1 in sets"
"Dear Twitterverse, may I please have a gif of Murray's F-bombs into the ESPN camera? I need it for future Mondays. Pls and thanks."
Did you know that 'Murray' was Trending Topic on Tuesday 8 for 4 hours in Edinburgh? http://t.co/wY3k6hCQmy #trndnl
"ESPN announces ""We're going to be here for awhile tonight"" -- Murray looks to run away with the 3rd set. up 3-1, with the serve."
FFS fell asleep with an open position on Murray during the 4th set.
Few games gone with serve. Murray now leads 5-4 in 3rd set. Anderson will now serve to stay in the set #USOpen
"Finally, on the 5th attempt, Anderson wins the second set 6-3, serving his 12th ace for the match to lead 2 sets to love against Murray."
"Fine margins in tennis. I think if Murray had won that 1st set tie-break, he'd be preparing for the q/f. Disappointing end to slam season."
"Game stretched over 2hrs,Murray breaks for the 1st time in the 3rd set,6-5,to serve for match point.....#USOpenWorld"

"I counted five tight points from Anderson in that game, may have been more. Gets a slice of fortune with Murray netting the BH. Holds for 41"
I fancy Anderson to eventually run out of puff if Murray can take the 3rd set. Big IF.
I like that Bellucci is making Murray work for it in this 3rd set! #usopen @usopen @ESPNTennis
"I'll have a lot more to say on Murray in a #USOpen wrap-up come next Monday, but for now, it's Kevin Anderson's moment in the sun."
I'm afraid of Murray though... He beat Belluci with ease in the 3rd round. Kevin's strong point is his serves!
I'm sure Murray will win the 3rd set but not sure if he would win the match.
INTERCEPTION. Simone picks off Murray. ASU 1st and 10 from the 12 yard line.
If Murray had won third set convincingly lets say 6-1/6-2/6-3. He would have gone on to win the 4th set.
"It just wasn't going to be Murray's tournament. A head cold, 2 very tricky 1st and 2nd round opponents and an inspired Anderson performance"
"It may just be me focusing on the losses, but Murray's tie-break record seems shite in my head, in big games at least."
Just started watching this Murray match 3rd set 3-4 and all jmac is talking about is Rafa/ fog WTF!!!
Just watched the 4th set breaker; Murray was pumped going into it... to lose it 7-0 is just incredible. #USOpen
"Konta has started well, at least on her own serve. Murray has a big moment at 4-4 in the 3rd, down 2 sets. #USOpen"
Kyle Allen making it happen. The injury to Murray may have been a blessing in disguise. Aggies back up 10.
"Looks like Murray is gonna have to do it the hard way again! 1 set down, 3-1 in the 2nd set! #ustennisopen"
Lovely overhead (coronal) #auroraborealis seen the night of September 6 at Fairbanks Alaska by M. Murray! http://t.co/ZliVjYjhHF
"Maybe Sunday was just a funny day for tennis, Murray on getting over a cold: ""My voice feels like normal again. Still dull, obviously."""
Microphone picking up Murray's F bomb at the sit down after the 2nd set...
"Might as well get the Djokovic vs Federer final on Sunday going, even if Murray was still in the field. Just seems destined for that."
"Monday #SEC Takeaway: Kyler Murray is electric, but #Aggies need to stick w/ Kyle Allen. Too one dimensional with Murray at QB right now."
"Monday at the US Open: Murray, Federer &amp; Konta are all in action at Flushing Meadows today http://t.co/50ZM0cOEjT http://t.co/YlLS4kf0of"
Murray &amp; Konta aim for last eight: Britons Andy Murray and Johanna Konta will be in fourth-round action at the US Open on Monday night.
Murray HOLDS! Now Anderson serves again to stay in the 3rd set with @Andy_Murray 6-5 up but two sets down. http://t.co/DhqfilpVDk
Murray a set down and 3-0 down in the 2nd set and bookies are laying Murray at Evens? Ridiculous
"Murray about to get sent home. That ranking means nothing man, 15th vs 1st and you would never know...#usopen2015"
Murray and Anderson going to 3rd set tiebreak.
Murray and Anderson have had 3 hour and 16 minute match and they are only going to the 4th set...
Murray avoids the sack and run for a 1st down.
Murray box reaction to winning the 3rd set #USOpen - Kim Sears and Frank Lampard make an appearance. http://t.co/EJiqDSe6Xj
Murray can't be happy with that tie-break esp. What did he need to do better this match? #usopen https://t.co/aThIQd6RlI
Murray down 0-30 but strings four in a row to stay alive. Up 6-5.  Can break here to win the set and serve first again in the 2nd...
Murray down a set and losing 5-2 in the 2nd set to the 6'8 Anderson. Hard to beat the big hitters when they're serving at their best.
Murray get his 1st break of the match to stay in this 2nd set 2-5. Can the No.3 seed continue to turn things around? #USOpen #ESPNTennis
Murray gets a warning for racquet abuse then proceeds to give his racquet to someone in the crowd. Anderson breaks back for *2-3 in the 3rd.
Murray gets the pass across. 1st and 10 from the 44.
Murray gives it his all but can't break Bellucci &amp; now he must hold at 4-5. Can he avoid a 4th set? http://t.co/u1QZis363L
Murray gives something else for ASU D to think about.... This may help Allen as well....
Murray going for more swear words than south park the movie! C'mon Andy you can turn this around! #usopen #passion
Murray holds to 30 and now Anderson leads 5-3 in the 2nd set. Anderson will serve for the set for a 2nd time #USOpen
Murray is 28 and at his peak. Not sure he can win another major. He may have to be content with his Wimbledon &amp; US Open wins. #murray
Murray is pissed here and in the march! Hope he pulls it off #USOpen
"Murray is so flat atm, if Anderson can get inspired at the start of the 2nd he can take control of this match."

A good  hold from Murray. 5-3 in 2nd. How is Anderson's head coping with this now?

Assuming Murray pulls it out here all 4 matches on Monday will be very intriguing.
Bellucci played a great 3rd set but Murray was just too good. He advances into week 2 with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 7-5 win #TeamMurray #usopen

Funimation's Tokyo Ghoul trailer was very strategic putting from the studio of Yu Yu Hakusho &amp; Naruto &amp; Bleach. Put the highest quality 1st
Guy opened the 8th gate and Naruto saved his ass.. GOAT
Himawari not even old enough for the academy took out Naruto with a finger who took on kaguya (a god) &amp; Sarada is on par w/ 4th War Sakura
How is it not obvious the 4th Hokage is Naruto's dad?! They basically put it in your face the second episode.
How long am I going to have to wait for Naruto to end and binge watch only the 4th shinobi war? #NoFillers
"How many times does Naruto say ""Believe it"" in one episode? the world may never know."

"I think i may work on buying complete manga, like Fullmetal Alchemist or Naruto, I'm just not sure yet"

"I told my homie if I was a Naruto character I'd be the 1st Hokage, he replied 'Well now I'm Madara'."

"If Naruto will be the 6th, and Sasuke is his rival then Sasuke is at the Kage rank as well."
"If Viz Media had licensed One Piece, Luffy may have been voiced by Maile Flanagan, who does Naruto. That's just me."
It could be possible cause I remember Orochimaru being a female In the 2nd chunin exam in Naruto He has 2 sex organs https://t.co/OKwWNmPaFK
"It may sound like I'm angry with Naruto....In a way, I kind of am. But, he's trained with the best. I know he'll be okay."

Naruto is the 10th Nakama and would be the last Strawhat Crew. Just my opinion. Sorry.
Naruto may have been the first ever Hokage to never achieve the status of Chunin and Jounin now that I think about it.....
Naruto smirks as the Fox quickly throws him towards @4thKonohaHokage   Naruto may be dumb but he remembered the seal placed upon him by his-
Naruto's son has alot to live up to ... he's the son of the 7th hokage and grandson of the 4th hokage

"@ShounenStrawHat it's a disgrace that the game came out in japan on 28th March smh,naruto games come out within a week worldwide"
@YeahItzJay Maybe Gaiden characters? 7th Hokage Naruto would be suuuuper lit. And Boruto comes out tmrw so maybe thats it
@YungTracFone to you I guess .... Naruto has the 4th hokage jutsu and even furthered it rather then perfected.
"@_Tjayy Oh, I remember that one. Pretty good. The one that's your 2nd favorite is my fav from the original Naruto."

I can grantee you that Niall and Camila are not dating. I mean you don't just ask a girl out randomly at a concert when you sat her once.
I feel bad for Niall girls because Niall hooked up with a girl and gave her his number and 7th row tickets for their concert... stay strong
"I feel like just yesterday louis was 18, and harry, Niall,Liam, and Zayn were 16 https://t.co/05i80pWR4q"
I get 2nd hand embarrassment from thinking about Niall during viva la vida on a daily basis
I had a dream I went to another otra show but Niall was sick and couldn't come so I just sat the whole time except during the fireworks
I haven't heard anything about Niall since Saturday is he dead or something
"I know Niall, it's Monday, the worst day of the week #DontTalkToNiall"
I may be mean with niall's legs sometimes but it doesnt mean i dont care
"I met Harry, Liam and Niall on 26 March, the day right after Zayn announced he's leaving, the boys looked heartbroken #5monthswithoutzayn"
I think it's weird when fans find celebrities' families on social media. You have no reason to like Niall's nephew's 1st day of school pic.
I'll do the Luke and Calum dms tomorrow and I might throw in a Liam and Niall one so follow and turn on notifs to be updated :)
I'm going to be so sad if I get to go to niall's hotel again on Saturday and he leaves like twenty minutes after I do again
I'm not ready for this 5th album. I wasn't even able to handle Niall and Louis and Liam's tweets yesterday about the rumors
If Niall is actually following people why can't he follow me like Niall c'mon stop making me emo
"Is anyone going to the US Open tennis tournament today? If so, Niall and Liam may show up again if not both of them Niall may .x"

"@imprisonedniall Niall loves you very much and you can see how much he loves you. Dont think that ! Every time you @ him, he may see it :)"
@irishkingnjh when Niall and I date I'll take them three out for dinner on the 14th and I'll just take them out once instead of three times
@littlestkinglou may I have a dm with Niall?:))
"@lookatnialler   That was Toronto I believe. I was about two feet to the left here, 4th row. When Niall threw himself to the floor, wow!"
@niallmyangelboy: Niam teased a song off the 5th album. such a tease..Look at Niall how cute he is.. ! https://t.co/UQ6J3qQiTI little shit

All i want for my birthday is a tweet from Niall or Louis.on The.9th @NiallOfficial  @Louis_Tomlinson
C'mon guys even if Niall and Camila are dating it's not bad.
"Camila may be on Niall's Instagram, but I'm on Harry's Instagram in his Baltimore picture. Kind of just gonna say I'm the winner here. :/"
Can we talk about the fact that I literally fell for Niall on Saturday.
Fans bought Niall a guitar to give to him at the OTRA Gillette show September 12! http://t.co/nXUqGvmQhQ
Goodnight friends I love you and Niall and I can't wait to sEE THE BOYS AGAIN TOMORROW AHHHHDNFCN

Holy sjit I'm going to see Niall dancing in front of me tomorrow
"I am so happy Niall still thinks Santa Clara was a cool show, it's was one the 2nd American leg date I love him"
I had a dream yesturday that I went to a one direction concert and sat front row and Niall waved to me and he hopped off stage and hugged me
I have to do an all about me project ik what is this 5th grade? but anyways I have to list my accomplishments and my only is a Niall follow
I hope I meet the boys on Saturday &amp; I hope Niall follows me &amp; @niaIloncraic &amp; @blackbownjh !!!!!
I hope Liam comes out tonight with balloons like Niall did for his 21st but on his arm how cute was that
I hope Niall is fine :(( Let's just give him the space he wants and hope he'll be back on his track tomorrow.
I hope Niall's day was better than the other day.hope tomorrow goes good also
I love waking up from a long ass dream of meeting Niall...........(it was so real and different than Sunday morning I'm soooo)
I may have only made 5 second eye contact with Niall but I feel like he understands me now
I met Camila back in April. My DNA on her hands. I love hanging out with Niall
I miss Niall so much he made me so happy on Saturday I felt at home and god I want to go back
I want to make a shirt with Niall's tweet and wear it every Monday
I was thinking about Niall and how he was really cute at 16 and then I remembered his 22nd birthday is in five days and I can't cope with it
"I'm mainly just waiting on Cameron's on the 8th, Jack G's on the 10th &amp; then Niall's on the 13th"
"I'm phone is going to died so goodnight i will be back tomorrow if i have time see you guys tomorrow goodnight to Harry,Niall,Liam, Louis"
Is it pointless for me to try to get a Niall follow? I may be part Irish but I swear I have no luck so I can't see it ever happening.
Looooong day. Can't wait to see Niall tomorrow :)
"Louis and Harry love home Sunday roast. Liam loves curry, while Niall loves all the food in general"
Louis was so cute when he was sat next to Niall at the last concert and he kept making him laugh and was all giggly with him
"Luckily the boys don't have a show tomorrow, really hope Niall will feel better soon :("
"New wish time :) 12.00 he meets harry, liam, niall and louis and his surgery goes well https://t.co/vZGyqp0jnT"
Niall has the sun glasses that I wANT WTF I want tHoSEEE!!!!!! @NiallOfficial gift them to me maaaaannnn http://t.co/uxMSFpmINc
"Niall is probably going to see 5sos tomorrow in NJ, love my luck :))"
"Niall is so beautiful his blue eyes, his smile he shines like a star or a sun he makes my day he's just so unconventionally beautiful."
Niall is so freaking cute j can't just imagine him sat there on his phone/laptop scrolling through all our tweets and laughing to himself
Niall on april 24th 2015 the best day he looked so good
Niall posted a pic of his hairy leg in the sun and im like wtf the fuck why so I scrolled and there was Zayn's beautiful face thank u
"Niall will follow me One Day  That day just isn't today, maybe tomorrow? @NiallOfficial"
"Niall's 22nd is coming way to early! I'm seriously so speechless,just always know that I'm here for ya!  @NiallOfficial @NiallOfficialPH"
Niall's charity drive for @autismdogsirl is at 44% now! Donate and spread the word please! Just a few more days!  https://t.co/XXNN2plPj7
"Niall's going to be 22 in 12 days NO ONE'S GONNA BE 22, I'LL LOCK HIM IN FOREVER21!1! *prepares squad* C'mon!"
Niall's laugh at the end of that snapchat is honestly the 2nd best part of the best snapchat every recorded
"On Niall's birthday on Sunday the 13th, we should all tweet a video on why we love and appreciate him. #HappyBirthdayNiall"
SEPTEMBER 5 so it means 8 days to go  before Niall's birthday huhu and 9 days to go before Cj's Birthday i miss this girl so much huhu
Sharing a bed way Niall on a Sunday morning being told of the pish I spoke last night
So Niall's tweet increased my already existing pcd....I need the 5th album to make me feel better...just saying.
The whole band and Niall are on the struggle bus today.. just get it together for the show tomorrow! @NiallOfficial @JoshDevineDrums
"Time for bed! Hope it rains tomorrow.... And wake up to a Harry, Niall, Liam, Louis and Zayn follow #MTVHottest One Direction"

"We may call Liam dad but let's be real, Niall is dad. Always havin a chat with people, checkin up on the wife and fam."
What's this? - you may ask. It's a fan project for Niall's birthday!  Want to get noticed by Niall? Make a video! http://t.co/9i4KyBzj8l
Why is everyone talking about Niall's bday it's not until the 13th ok I have 8 more days until I panic bc he's 22
Why is no one talking about the fact that Niall's birthday is almost here. Or the fact the boys can drop the 5th album any day now
"by tomorrow, my layout will hopefully consist of a selfie with Niall and otra fireworks fingers crossed people"
do you know that moment when you stare at the sun and your eyes start to cry because it's so bright? that happens to me when i look at Niall
"do you remember when Niall sang ""Beautiful Girls"" in his 21st birthday, good times can he just sing that again like can he just do it please"

one time in the 7th grade I wrote Niall is daddy on my hand &amp; my teacher was yelling at me to show him what it said &amp; I licked/rubbed it off
please change the 10th ww trend into Niall and Bianca yes much better!
remember when niall played croke on my bday. he was soo happy!! day I found out I could officially go to wwa miami too. may 23rd. good day:)
the only thing brighter than the sun is Niall's smile -my brother just made my day
tmh change my mind when Niall waved at my section was the 2nd best day of my life after otra when I heard through the dark live
"tomorrow it's my birthday and well, it would mean the world to me if a specific guy names Niall would notice me @NiallOfficial"
"wanted to say that you're my beautiful little idiot, you may be as funny as Harry but it's cute. P.S: Niall loves his princess;) @cumlarry_"
"we don't get enough Niall in yellow, I don't like the color but he looks like the sun in it #MTVHottest One Direction"
@NiallOfficial Hello Niall i love you so much you make me smile make me better may you please kindly follow me i hope you have a fab day 3
All I want in life is to meet Niall tomorrow but I'm 10000% sure that won't happen
Happy Birthday Niall for the 13th! Have an amazing day!! @NiallOfficial http://t.co/NInRkUtYGC
I get to see the love of my life for the 4th time omgjsjsnznz NIALL
niall's voice is just TOO GOOD this 5th album will kill me
@MileyCyrus I dreamed about katy perry dragging Nicki's back for you on sunday and it was very fatal. I hope it's gonna happen
"@Nicki_F @ThalesLives @scottedelman You may disagree Nicki, but the facts just don't support you. Nor does the vote by all of fandom."
@TMZ Miley may act and be the way she is but she is a good person. Nicki is the one looking for fights anywhere. Embarrassing...
"@itsbl0ndie I still think it was fake. I always thought Nicki to be the type to call you out on a random Tuesday, not at an awards show"
"@musicnews_shade azealia may not be the most famous rapper of all time but sadly, nicki's songs are in billboard for her physique not talent"
"@nice_feminist she may be a """"""""problematic fave"""""""" but there's NO reason for her to be getting dragged just cuz Nicki said some shit"
@rayshellbox Kasi nga diba may prejudice pa rin about black entertainers? Also Miley says that Nicki keeps pulling the race card--
"@spectralpixie nicki can't even get her 3rd album to go gold lmfao  Nicki copies off Kim's OLD shit, Kim was the first female with --"
"A no no, Kanye announces he's running for president, and nicki gets crazy with Miley all in the the same night.. It's Sunday wtf"
A woman called Nicki a wee bitch and spat because she sat down in front of her on the 11
"All Nicki said was ""what's good"" like c'mon now we get it she a bad bitch ok"
"And tomorrow Nicki is going to be seen as ""a raging angry black women"" for calling Miley out of something that she is GUILTY for"
Do you guys remember that not too long ago Nicki was like one of the most hated artist.. During her Pink Friday album
"I think Nicki made an ass out of herself last night. 1st you call the VMA's racist, 2nd then you perform and accept an award at the VMA's"
I'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and Nicki is being the shady bitch queen she is and I just lost all focus
"If Nicki didn't have her ass, she'd be shorter when she sat down."
If you think Nicki's ass is more than 1/8th real you are fuuucked
Kanye and Nicki are the reason they may have to do away with award shows. YOU say it's about artists but you two always make it about YOU.
"Literally 1st time I've ever watched the #VMAs. Miley called Nicki out on her CRAP, and I respect that. #sorrynotsorry #suckitupnicki"
Lost some respect for Nicki after that. You may be a queen in the rap world but when u start shit at an award show u look like garbage #VMAs
Miley has no tits &amp; ass but Kim and Nicki may have the same botox injection expert and Kim ain't got shit to lose. https://t.co/EEjrWcrHzw
"Miley is the 8th most hated person in America, idk why y'all are acting like Nicki gets more hate than Miley"
Nicki dead ass sat in our fAces and lied to us about meek. bye http://t.co/XTK1x0URvo
Nicki's butt is just too big like c'mon that's not even fun anymore like
"So whats good Miley? @MileyCyrus ...lol Nicki with that fuck shit,we may as well make a song about it. Hit me up. I ghost write like Quentin"
"This ain't the 1st day I've ever called Nicki ignorant, fuck. I'm on and off w/ her. Its simple, &amp; I don't always like how she handle shit."
Why is Nicki always calling someone out on stage .. Bitch looks so trashy while Miley just sat there and took what she said with class
Yall act like Nicki really Finna mess up Taylor's moment ............for the 2nd time again. #VMAs
i want mildew clitoris off my tl i dont want her anywhere near nicki i dont want to see her rat ass ever again launch her into the sun
"i'm tweeting this for the 2nd time, nicki needs to realize that people don't buy her music NOT BECAUSE SHE ISN'T ""SKINNY AND WHITE""+"
miley.. you better watch out for nicki backstage she may throw hands
tbh if tomorrow ppl start going after Nicki for what she said im gonna be pissed
"(Nicki chuckled.) So, you just got here in Sun City? https://t.co/AIrLJlok7G"
*sends bae video of drake looking at nicki like she the sun* why u dont look at me like that
"1. Drake  2,3,4 is Sean, Kendrick, Cole whatever u want the order to be   5. no idea who in that 5th spot...Nicki? I'll leave that to y'all"
1st of all...why didn't Meek help Nicki to the stage. I would have cussed him to filth
"1st time I've watched the vmas in years .. What, did Nicki just...."
1st: Taylor and Avril 2nd: Taylor and Nicki 3rd: Taylor and Katy????  Hahahaahhahahhh.. maybe its the start of the new beginning???
"2nd one is a trinidadian headdress i believe, which is nicki's home country. im silent on the other 3 tho https://t.co/0udsnLtBeC"
"5SOS won, Taylor &amp; Nicki had a duet, Nicki looked like she wanted to beat the crap out of Miley. Waking up to this, Monday is good for once!"
@Ashley_Chenelle is she cussing out Nicki? I may need to learn how to work this tv
@BaconBitsBitch lol.. I agree w Nicki and Sammy 1st and second Miley might be doing good deeds OK but she's literally a fucking mess. So shh
"@DaRealAmberRose hey amber are you free November 14th. I asked Nicki but her best friend told me she has a boyfriend, that's clear."
@DaRealKhefner: When Nicki see Miley Sunday: https://t.co/NF2F3AFZOF   the accuracy
@ERINJEEN you may dress like nicki and amelia may dress like miley
"@GrilledCamwich you're missing the whole point onto what Nicki was trying to say. it may be mtv wasn't racist, but many times"
"@HighOnVibe Depends what she said though, Nicki may have had a reason to start! Have you seen the video?"
@HipHopWired LMAO Nicki can never fuck with Kim. Kim's Black Friday diss record lyrically slaughtered Nicki. What are u talkin bout???
@Just_Kendall @MoneyTalker_K @Drake Nicki wrote everything drake a emotion soft ass nigga crying cause he wasn't 1st in line my dad meek won
@LeilaJoldusic Lmaooo but the Nicki controversy may get people talking
@Minajlb @SOFTXSHUG but Nicki dissed her first n threw the 1st shots all d while copying her
@NICKIMINAJ sat here and rewatched Nicki's opening and that is all for tonight
"@NicoletteKelley Set a reminder: October 6. Get ready to join the celebration around #AllDayBreakfast, Nicki!"
@OnikaThot Nicki was trying to or the producers told her to discredit Mariah there and Mariah sat her bc she's still more successful
"@SarahSahadinCBB You can always meet them on the Friday shakedown as Nicki said that'd be better, so it probably will be for the others! ;)"
"@TMZLive @MTVNews Miley &amp; Nicki staged it. Not only did NM break a smile, from the 2nd c-angle Miley says ""what"", before Nicki states topic"
"@ayahmdee13 I think her and Nicki opened the show. But never got to watch it. And, I think I may have been watching the backstage haha"
@bieberloundon i feel like Nicki may have been joking but miley may not have known. Nicki is so vocal on twitter i feel like she
"@dquintia_ Nicki's role may be essential, but it is not a role to defend publicly. Do you get what I mean?"
"@eh_kees perception is 9/10th of reality. Because we perceive Meek as ""not good enough"" for Nicki. His support looks like he is star struck"
@garcia_syanne are you going over auntie nicki's tomorrow?
"@gatheringcopal Lol It just seems like Nicki like to really take things to the 3rd nipple. Miley, Mariah, Kim, Taylor, list goes on"
@highsociety_k @teamkimlisa account to Kims MOTHER Kim was born 1976 she turned 39 July 11. Nicki will be 33 in 4 months. My accuracy &gt; urs
@leslimorale5 That's like saying Kim never actually said Nicki's name in Black Friday. You know who was the target.
@naidej_ I'll tell you more tomorrow but Miley was throwing shade at Nicki and Nicki just called her out
"@nycki96 @tigrayrocks WE aren't too far apart, Nicki. In fact, we may be at the same point. I don't remember if I stopped at 11 or 12."
@vertivangogh I may watch them just to see why people are saying Nicki called out Miley lol. That was probably deserved.
@zackrorz but people hated way before then tbh and I think it may have been directed at lil' Kim other than Iggy because Nicki denied later
"All he said is that it was funny, and weren't you up Nicki's ass in July? https://t.co/MnZZR01bDP"
All the talk will be about Nicki and Miley tomorrow. Nothing else has been talk worthy. #VMAs
Alone at a McDonald's. Few vestibules away people are talking about Mar's presidency run while the other table talks about Nicki's VMA feud.
"And that Nicki and Miley ""beef"" looked toooo staged, Nicki smiled, Miley response was too instant (like she been practisin it).. c'mon MTV"
Ask a kid watching the #VMAs where they were when Nicki called Miley out...now ask them what happen Nov 22 1963 (crickets). #SoSad
Azealia Banks may find herself in another hot situation after she involved herself in the Miley Cyrus and Nicki... http://t.co/BUZ6UjCoCD
"Basically my Sunday-Monday transition   ""@en_jajaja: Nicki: thank you to my pastor Nicki: SO BITCH YOU WAS TALKIN MAD SHIT WHAT UP W THAT"""
"Be prepared to listen about Nicki and Miley tomorrow at school, or maybe Kanye"
Because Nicki actually looked up to Kim but Kim came at her for no reason?? Why argue with someone you idolized? https://t.co/LjIu2xxZiL
"Bet when Nicki sat down next to meek she said ""now thats how you handle a beef nigga"" #VMAs #NickiMinaj"
Boohoo Miley called Nicki unpolite KIM CALLED HER EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN just admit NICKI KNOW WHO TO TRY
Boy...Kenryn just asked me if Nicki goin march in a second line...lmaoo
"But Miley, what IS good? I think Nicki needs an answer on her desk by tomorrow morning if you wanna keep ya scalp."
"Can't wait to see the lame ass ""think pieces"" about how Nicki is ""an angry black woman"" and how she was ""mean"" to Miley tomorrow"
Damn.... Miley Cyrus needs to watch it that bitch is gonna get sat on and crushed by Nicki.
Don't act like Azealia won't jank Nicki in her shit. She may be a skinny but she got them four weights.
Hi my name iSSk Nicki and itsSSKS tHFfe firSSKT day of sShckhool - me in my new retainer tomorrow
"I can't lie that ""Black Friday"" my baby Nicki took an L, fuck Kim she been ran thru more than McDonalds drivethru  https://t.co/o2gL0EijAb"
"I do have some complaints about this this beautiful Sunday night. First, miley handled that well. Nicki should be... http://t.co/4pAjjyTGhd"
"I don't get too riled up, because Nicki may be dancing with Miley onstage at the next awards show. #VMAs"
I don't think Nicki's pregnant. Stomach was flat again in the side view. Think she was just sticking her butt out in the 1st pic.
I feel like I'm in 3rd grade again watching the VMAs.   Kanye is to Trump as Nicki is to Miley.
I feel like she's trying to do a Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded thing like Nicki but it's literally just Flaming Lips album rejects.
I get that marriage equality probably isn't an issue that directly affects Nicki so she may focus on it less...
I just realized today is Sunday y'all Nicki and Kanye were preachin to the choir
I like Meek Mills when he raps because he talks like a handicapped 4th grader...how do he and Nicki hold conversations???
I like to avoid my Monday's like Miley avoided Nicki at the VMAs
I may even include a rendition of Nicki's 'death stare' she shot at Miley last night
"I may joke, but Nicki's totally valid points about a racist system will be forgotten again because of a white woman's comments"
I remember when haterade by Nicki pharrell and Gucci was my ringtone in the 4th grade
"I start school tomorrow and I'm here watching Kanye rant, Miley and Nicki go at it and Tori Kelly blow the roof out of the #VMAs"
I still think they should have let Nicki continue what she was going to say rather then cut her off cuz it may hurt Miley's feelings
"I still would like a Nicki follow, but if she followed me, she'd just be a flop that followed me.  https://t.co/DhxDzeUZog"
"I think sure Nicki may have been joking though, if she had real beef I feel like it would be a lil scarier."
I thought this may have been entertaining after nicki's moment but it's actually very painful
I was just stalking Nicki's IG and now I have to work out for 18 hours tomorrow
I wish Nicki would have flew across the stage and slapped that hoe !  https://t.co/D9dtRKeZji
I wonder if they'll cut out Nicki calling Miley out when they air it again tomorrow
"I'm a bit annoyed about what miley said about nicki. Taylor started the pop star against pop star war, nicki didn't even sat her name"
I'm at work for 14.5 hours tomorrow lmao someone make me go to bed and stop reading articles about nicki
I'm literally nervous for what Kanye may say tonight...he more of a loose cannon than Nicki
If I rise tomorrow and there's no sign of 1) Zayn throwing a public tantrum or 2) Nicki taking over the world then I'm checking out of life
If the weeknd doesn't clear up the rumors about him disliking black women tomorrow I might have to pull a kayne on him then pull a Nicki
It looks like Nicki may be very small in person. Well small with a big butt lol.
It's Monday and I just need to know the status of this Nicki and Miley beef...
Just watched how Nicki called out bitch Miley Cyrus on stage at the #VMAs. May the one who has the biggest ass wins.
K. I'm just already done with everyone. I don't think I'll be talking to anyone tomorrow. I'm so close to havin my own Nicki moment...
Like Miley said she didn't look into everything but she thought Nicki may have been subbing her but she didn't know for sure. Her words.
Lol watch how the media paints Nicki as an angry black woman tomorrow morning and miley as the victim #bye
"Lol. You can still watch, Nicki asked Miley what's good and called her a bitch (most interesting part of the show) https://t.co/tCIdK88LtI"
Meek Mill dissed Future too? Nicki may as well start giving him an allowance cause it's all over.
Meek about to have a 2nd wave coming from twitter bc Nicki came harder without a song haha
Miley better pick up the Hannah Montana wig again because that may be the only she'll hide from Nicki. #VMAs2015
Miley was a child actor.I'm sure most of the net worth is from the Hannah Montana days.C'mon now. Don't play Nicki.  https://t.co/ovhZyCwYOy
More like Taylor wants to stay the hell away from Miley bc she saw how Nicki dragged her Sunday. https://t.co/Xo7KkQWeSS
NYFW doesn't begin until Thursday. Y'all gonna get Nicki inadvertently cursed out cz mfs gonna think she stayed home.
Nicki &amp; Tay may be friends but I'm still not a fan like was Nicki for real about Miley this is too much for my emotions Im so confused #VMAs
Nicki Minaj Confronts Miley Cyrus Live on Stage at the VMA's. Sunday night Nicki called Miley out in a way that... http://t.co/NJ6dJO7HZ8
Nicki and Miley left nothing to the imagination at Sunday night's VMA's.
"Nicki carried Taylor so much in that performance, tomorrow she's going to need a Nicki massage. #VMAs"
Nicki dead hasn't sat in an audience of an award show (besides BET) in awhile. She can't be bothered with those YTs.
Nicki does not have the time to be shady she will deadass drop the tea on ya lap and let you get a 3rd degree burn
"Nicki has no class? Mf got a fish in his avi. You get off to the smell of fish right? C'mon bitch step ya dick up, TWEET @ ME. @dmart4511"
"Nicki is always feuding with somebody. Lil Kim, Mariah Carey, Iggy Azalea, Taylor Swift, now Miley Cyrus... I like her but c'mon"
Nicki is gonna open with trini dem girls on the pinkprint tour in south africa on the 2nd leg
Nicki just gave this pastor a shout out but didn't attend Sunday school last Sunday. Man please.
"Nicki may be thinking it's better to confront her, as other people will think they can try it too. Which is true. Just my opinion."
Nicki may have called Miley out but Miley's messages tonight were much more powerful than any performance at the VMAs
Nicki may have forgiven Taylor... but I still think she's corny for what she did.
"Nicki may look Hollywood, but you hear every bit of New York when she opens her mouth."
Nicki may need a wardrobe change if she plans on winning anything else tonight. #VMAs
Nicki went from I want to thank my Pastor to cursing at Miley. That may beat what Kanye did to Taylor Swift.
Nicki's pastor is mad af right now. And it's Sunday smh
No really Nicki may have been the only black female artist we saw tonight

One of pop music's ugliest feuds kicked off at the MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday when Nicki... http://t.co/ZmqJoAmkfA
Part of me thinks Nicki is so serious about her attitude towards Miley tho. She may be cool with her but she was a little serious. #VMAs
Performing with black artist doesn't take away the fact that Nicki gave you a 3rd degree burn with her tea hunty.  https://t.co/tfVO1VQJof
"Power's out for 47 hrs and: #kanye2020 , twenty one pilots perform, Nicki drags Miley, probably the sun exploded too let me check"
Remember that time Wayne ran across the show to help Nicki up the stairs but tn Meek just sat in his seat while my mom had to wait for Rebel
Remember this when you watch the news stories about Nicki tomorrow morning. http://t.co/ql1hPfQ7O7
School tomorrow is gonna be fired up HA! you got something to say bad about Nicki? Prepare your argument you're bout to get shut down
She said something about Nicki? How dare she...the actual question is who is she like seriously is she famous or sum https://t.co/0W0VOtfVdj
Snaps to Nicki! I may not like her but get it https://t.co/nsJxJTuuRK
So Meek just sat on his ass and didn't walk Nicki up to the stage?  #VMAs2015
So Miley don't know Nicki from Southside Jamaica Queens. Where people slap you because it's Tuesday.
Stop it Nicki said all that behind a smile https://t.co/VdEWp6aRLe
"Taylor told Nicki weeks ago she can come on stage if she wins an award &amp; Nicki was ""nah bitch ima bring you on stage so I can do it 1st"""
That's how you handle a beef lil ass nigg. - Nicki to Meek after she sat down from receiving the award.
The sad part about this is tomorrow Nicki will be the angry black woman who went after poor white girl Miley
This may be unexpected but I found a very special lady with similar personalities! Nicki and Miley beef is over! @misstaylertexas
"Tomorrow at work, when people talk to me, I'm just going to slap my crotch and twerk in response. See if I get the same reaction Nicki did."
"Wait, did Taylor bring Nicki on stage when she won on Sunday? I didn't think so..."
"Watch Nicki call Miley out. Watch Miley's reaction. Watch Rebel's ""whoa"" in the background. C'mon, BuzzFeed. Let us collectively get a life."
What I love most about this is that every hag will be on DCUM tomorrow talking a t how trashy Nicki or Bey is. When clearly...#VMAs
What these white people at school tomorrow have SO MUCH to say about Nicki!!!!! #ImReady
What's good this Thursday? #TBT to Nicki and Miley's heated exchange at the #VMAs! #MileyWhatsGood : https://t.co/dPVOiXezx8

"Where's Nicki's style or her 2nd 1mil sold album?? Keep changing topics when u get clocked,its right here with u https://t.co/fLxP74dTI8"

"so @Abbij1798 her ex texted her &amp; spelled Nicki ""niki"" that's his first problem. 2nd problem is he doesn't know I go to CA &amp; I always tweet?"
"sorry mom I can't go to school tomorrow, I need time to cope with Nicki killing Miley"

@Iovemyths Watch: even tho that was Nicki responding 2 Miley putting her on blast 1st the media will make it out like Nicki picking a fight.
@Likeitornotmama @LILKIMQOR Its not... Nicki garnered the success she has today because of what her 2nd album entailed AND the look.
@Likeitornotmama @jda927 Lil Kim will be remembered as the 3rd/4th most successful female rapper. Nicki will/is the 1st. Numbers don't lie.
@LuxxSOCIAL @Raheem_TM it may have have gotten a higher score never denied that fact....but Nicki's album is STILL critically acclaimed. Lol

"Nicki is FED UP! When she 1st came out she was bashed for her creativity, her body, her music. Now her opinions. I don't blame her."
Nicki is a great woman I don't care what you say. I may don't like her music a lot but she's very intelligent.
"Nicki is so hot and out of all the fine qualities she has, her teeth just may be my fav one. Not her butt, but her teeth."
Nicki is the most talked about tonight and will be tomorrow. No doubt!
Nicki is the only reason my HW gets done tbh.  https://t.co/hyzutcbTuT

"When Nicki came into the game Bey was working on her 4th solo #1 album after selling millions, so for Nicki to share the same stage is a lot"
Why do y'all want Nicki to be pregnant so bad like maybe around the 7th album but she's literally still in her prime.

Red Sox with a lot of work to do to try and win this. 13-5 down in the 8th.

@CageRage7 @FrontRowBrian Styles make fights. Rousey may very well win but there's no way she is running through Holm.
@ClayTravisBGID I like your work but that Money May V. Rousey is ludicrous. I couldn't even finish reading it.
@ClayTravisBGID can't believe all the negative response to Rousey article. Fight needs to happen. She'd drop him in 1st round!
@DamonMartin Underdog Holm has LESS time to prepare for Rousey. Not calling conspiracy just saying she's not ready. Jan 2 was too soon. #mma

@Dustin_LongNJ Seriously. May as well just watch WWE at this point. At least you know it's a front. I mean Rousey vs. Holm? C'mon.
@HelloJapan1 @Chris81203 @TP_Grant  i wouldn't be that harsh. she may exploit holes in Rousey's standup game.   ...maybe.

@StaceGots I feel like Bomani vs. Rovell intellectually is roughly equivalent to Rousey vs. a 4th grader in the octagon.
@TStape03 Rousey is going to destroy again. Waiting for her to finally fight Cyborg. I think CM Punk may end up fighting Cathal Pendred.

@ULTMMA Cyborg did nothing (for lack of a better term) to progress WMMA and now suddenly the narrative is Rousey's ducking her? C'mon.
@Wolfman42069 @JoshSamman Just think there may be more interesting match-ups for Rousey (spoiler: she still wins) than ANOTHER rematch.
"@arielhelwani Counting Holms, this will be the 3rd opponent in a row that has a 9-0 record before fighting Rousey. #UFC"
@arielhelwani Let Rousey and Tate fight and have Cyborg on the same card at 135. If Rousey and Cyborg both win then have the fight in April
@bdf522 No way she makes it past the 1st rd. She has had a rough transition to MMA she is in no way near prepared for Rousey
@calamityford  Going intn med overdrive with Chynna and Rousey. Symptoms. : / Wondering if fleas may b catalyst. Grr!  Coffee time! HUGSXO
@dacanes3 yeah. I just expect cyborg to accuse the UFC and Rousey of being afraid of her when the dec fight doesn't get booked.
"@danawhite I'm telling you, one of these Brazilians may be lucky enough to put an end to Rousey's reign. Nunes is an up-and-coming opponent."
"@danawhite McGregor vs Aldo and Rousey vs Tate 3 December 5th, Dallas, TX AT&amp;T Stadium....sound good to you?"
@danawhite The 2nd time in the UFC to beat Rousey and a 3rd time to beat Rousey in a rematch. Then she said she's done at 135.
@danawhite is it true that you weren't 1st to tell Miesha she wasn't getting the Rousey fight? Understand why you went with Holly but c'mon
@danawhite wait a tick Nunes cannot fight Tate forgot she is set to fight Rousey again for the 10th time lol j/k
"@dannyodwyer McGregor vs Aldo coming Dec.12. So, we going halvsies on PPV? Ha. They need to hurry up and throw Rousey vs. Cyborg on there."
@girl_fights it may be different but the ending would still see Rousey with the W.
@jeremybotter @AdamHillLVRJ if Rousey got hit with 9 significant strikes Sat I'm passing.may take Cyborg if enough $$$ comes in on Rousey
@mcdiana I thought it was over like a Rousey fight. It may go into 4th qtr.

Holly Holm's boxing may give her the ability to out point Rousey on the feet but what's her take down defence like?

Holm isn't quite ready for Rousey. But I'm with @_HOLLYHOLM  https://t.co/Ejd8hXmfJB

@reverseleo Seth Rollins had a title match with John Cena  Seth Broke his nose And now people want title shots cause cena may not make it
A feud with John Cena may be enough to make me interested in Seth Rollins again. There has to be some irony in there.

"It's $125 for the Seth Rollins meet and greet on Friday. Seth, I love you and all and your my favorite wrestler but HELL NO"

Seth Rollins absolutely has to win this Sunday if they don't want to ruin him forever now.
Seth Rollins becomes the 3rd man in history (Goldberg &amp; Booker T) to hold both World Championship &amp; United States Championship #SummerSlam
Seth Rollins has always been the future and being  the guy to finally beat cena just solidified his legacy #1st #TitleforTitle
"Seth Rollins has nothing to worry about. As long as he wears white and gold, he'll be fine on the 20th. #WWE #Raw #ColorsOfChampions"
Seth Rollins is going to be at the house show in Beaumont. So i think he may win. I really doubt the WWE WHC will be at a house show #RAW
Seth Rollins kicks off #RAW and he may have a message for Sting.
Seth Rollins may be a 'coward' or a 'sellout' but he is definitely an awesome little ninja! #SummerSlam #TitleForTitle #CenaVsRollins

Seth rollins would have been a great champion if he does all things whatever he says every monday night on #raw in the middle of this ring
That was stupid by John Stewart but who cares Seth Rollins is now the 1st man to hold WWE title &amp; US title together #SummerSlam
This may be the fashionista in me (#ShaneIsMrX) but #ComradeOfTheDay is also bestowed upon New Day's &amp; Seth Rollins' ring gear.
"Time to start Monday Night #RAW with a typical (generic) opening promo from Seth Rollins, such greatness."
Tonight Monday night was fucking great a lot of supper stars came and so did sting and he beat the hell out of Seth Rollins that's we do
"Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch......... This Sunday, Imma make you mines. - @JohnCena to Seth Rollins, lmao that was a great promo."

When was the last time we've had a subpar Monday Night #Raw? Tonight looks to be no different! Seth Rollins is gold.
Why is Stone Cold on the cover of #WWE2K16? He's hardly ever on anymore. Seth Rollins would be better. This may declare a no buy for me!
YAAASSS hire him full time so he and Seth Rollins can beef forever https://t.co/30K6SHOohk
"Yeah, I think I want a Seth Rollins shirt. Cuz that's what champions do. His 1st-X-Men-movie-costume pants wouldn't hurt, either. #raw"

Seth Rollins def. John Cena to become #WWELinear Champion for the 4th time! Rollins ends Cena's 16th reign as champ! http://t.co/JEPgIWMYaa
"'There's no point to Sharknado, they may as well as had Slothnado. Sloths killing ppl with their hooks'"
@Ike58Reese or just watch something more meaningful than Sharknado!! Cmon man! May i suggest @neiltyson 's #cosmos - feed your brain yo
"@MattFossen @FrankConniff 1st, they did do Plan 9. 2nd, Sharknado is not earnestly bad, it's ironically so. That's why MST3K wouldn't work"
"A 60 mile flame burning hotter than the surface of the sun!?!  Come on Sharknado, that is even ridiculous for you."
All you people watching Sharknado tomorrow are they terrorists hate us.
How did Sharknado get a 3rd film? How did Sharknado even get a film to begin with? Life doesn't make much sense.
I am not in the right frame of mind to attempt to watch Sharknado 3 yet. I may need to start drinking.
I can't believe people really like Sharknado enough for them to make a 3rd part. So stupid.
"I don't even understand how Sharknado is even a thing, let alone having a 3rd movie. The SE suck, the acting sucks, and it's so dumb I laugh"
I dont understand the obsession with Sharknado.... watched the first two and they sucked. Im sure the 3rd one is just as bad.
"I figured Sharknado was played out at #2 &amp; tonight we get #3?   I won't be watching, just like the 1st 2"
I hate the Sharknado fandom. It's a poor imitation of so bad it's good. Also I  don't care if April lives #suckmynado
I sat through the whole of Sharknado 2 I'm pretty sure NS is nothing compared to that shit.
"I think Sharknado 3 may have jumped the shark, and gone too far down the make a bad movie road. The second half is just awful in a bad way."
I'm convinced listening to the Freak Show tomorrow morning will be WAY better than that Sharknado ending. @fsmikey @FSBigBob
It sucks we live in a world where Sharknado is about to start a 4th sequel but we can't get a Tron 3 or Dredd 2.
Just starting to watch Sharknado 4 the 1st time. Craptacular already. Cc @beerlytweeting @hadyngreen
Okay the first Sharknado was funny but do we really need a 4th movie? I think I lost a few brain cells after watching the 3rd
"Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No, is that the movies title or just everyone's reaction when they heard a 3rd one was being churned out?"
"Sharknado 3 comes on tonight. Yes, a movie about a shark tornado has made it to a 3rd movie, and yes, I too have lost all faith in humanity."
Sharknado 3 may have overdone it just a little bit. And that's saying something for a Sharknado movie.
Sharknado is definitely the best of the worst. Come see the spectacle this Thursday at 6 &amp;9pm in the RH Theatre! http://t.co/lfOjKxaM9q
"Sharknado is one of the worst movies in existence, but I'm watching it for the 10th time for some unknown reason"
"Sharknado is the silliest film franchise so badly produced I cudnt stop laughing through the 2nd, I saw sharks flying n had to call it a day"
Shout out to @ZombeaversMovie for being the worst movie since @SharknadoSyfy... Sharknado has a chance to reclaim the title tomorrow...
"The 1st Sharknado was good, the 2nd bad and the 3rd was just pathetic. They are making a 4th, but I'm done with them now! #sharknado"
"The Great Wall of Sharknado, the 9th Wonder of the World. Oh, HELL NO! #Sharknado3"
The Zoo miniseries may be the worst collection of images &amp; sounds man has ever produced. We're talking Sharknado w/o the self-awareness.
The fact that there is a 3rd Sharknado is everything that is wrong with this world...   Lamer than my #LameJoke collection...   #Sharknado3
"Unfollowing anyone tweeting about Sharknado, may god have mercy on yr soul"
Who knew there were enough people in the world easily pleased by shite like Sharknado that they're getting a 4th instalment?!
Why does someone make the effort to produce a 3rd movie of Sharknado anyways lmao
may i just say the lighting in Sharknado 3 could use a little work?????
@yuu_naoyuki this is the 3rd one. Check Sharknado and Sharknado 2 too. XD it's horrible that it's hilarious. This is a really bad movie.
It may be significant to some of those who enjoy movies with a cult following but Sharknado is a disgrace to the film industry
Sharknado 3 may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.
Sharknado may be the worst movie ever created
Sharknado may well be the flat out dumbest thing ever to occupy a TV screen.
Sharknado was funny the first time. We humored them for the 2nd. But a THIRD? Even I'm not enough of a fan of bad movies to watch that shit.
#AprilLives  No Sharknado without April.  Love a chick with a sawhand
#Dodgers roll after Sharknado.  That's just fact. https://t.co/ljNBMAl22k
#Offline Goodnight my Sharknado followers love you all back tomorrow remember #AprilLives

Can't wait for tomorrow . . . won't have to hear about Sharknado anymore.
"Columbus friends, are any of you willing to go see the Sharknado 3 premier with me tomorrow night? Actual party downtown, not a theatre!"
"Cost of running the 1st advertisement in Sharknado 3 probably rivals the Super Bowl. Nice play there, @hotelsdotcom."
Dad said he can't go to party on the patio tomorrow because he needs to be home so he can watch Sharknado. Cool.
Enjoying Sharknado for the 3rd time in a row #Sharknado3
"Finally getting a chance to watch Sharknado 3. I liked the 1st one a lot and loved the 2nd one, so I've really been looking forward to it."
From the makers of the Sharknado franchise comes a new movie on Saturday called Lavalantula. I must see this.
George is LIVE tweeting during the premiere of Sharknado 3 tomorrow!  Join in! http://t.co/sPRT4dIn9L
Going to get drunk and watch the badness that is Sharknado 3. This is going to be a good Sunday night.
"Good Thursday morning, #Weatherhounds! Glad to see y'all survived the Sharknado outbreak more or less intact."
Hanging with my Monsters on a Saturday night watching Sharknado ! They love it ! #Sharknado3 http://t.co/ckzCiTZVlZ
Happy Sharknado 3 eve. May the plot be thin and the cameos ridiculous.
Hey @TaraReid Sharknado is all about April!! You better be in Sharknado 4 Team April all the Way! Tara U Rock! http://t.co/6uRApfph2q
Hey @billengvall:  can't wait for Sharknado 3 tomorrow night! What is the name of your character?  Woo hoo!!  @SharknadoSyfy #GaryMartinHays
Hopefully y'all is still doing the vote for April thingy on sharknado! #AprilDies
"How's everyone's Saturday night? Don't lie. Ur laying in your bed with your smartphone up in the air, with Sharknado 3 in the background."
I can't wait to go to the beach then watch sharknado tomorrow
"I don't care if April is dead or alive, I just can't wait for Sharknado 4"
I got my sister's kids to watch Sharknado. They're asking about the 3rd one already
"I have grown to love @TaraReid's character, April, throughout the Sharknado franchise. #Sharknado3"
I have watched every Sharknado and have made plans to watch the 3rd one. Let's goooo
I hope I can catch Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No tomorrow night idc how bad it is
I like Sharknado but I don't like the April character
"I like that there's no messing around in Sharknado, just action. You don't even have to wait 10 mins for the 1st sharky sequence! #OhHellNo"
I may get killed for this but I watched 15 minutes of pretty little liars. The girls acting ability is as good as the acting in Sharknado.
I may or may not have just DVR'd the Sharknado trilogy for Saturday. Can't wait to see what the hype is about. #sorrynotsorry
"I see Jimmy made it into sharknado, so wnci should be hilarious tomorrow."
"I want them to amp all the way up to an 11th Sharknado, then do 12th where two guys in shark costumes just reenact ""My Dinner With Andre."""
I want to see Sharknado 3.  Someone record it onto a DVD tomorrow and bring it to the track Thursday.
Id rather watch sharknado on repeat all day than have to get up at 5 tomorrow (:
"If I don't go to the gym tomorrow night, I can watch SHARKNADO 2 again. It has been too long since I watched."
If you're not planning to watch Sharknado 3 tomorrow then idk what you're doing with your life tbh
Is it weird I'm excited for Sharknado 3 tomorrow night?
It's the Saturday of a long weekend and I'm at home watching Sharknado. This is my new life.
It's time for Sharknado 3. We know how to live it up on Saturday night.
"JUST WATCHED SHARKNADO 3 AND HOLY SHIT THE END WITH APRIL, the giving birth in a shark is new to me.. #aprillives #sharknado3 @SharknadoSyfy"
"Jake and I will be in Sharknado 4. We may die in the first scene, but we'll be in it. #HollywoodDreams"
"LRT: I'm planning to watch Sharknado 3 tomorrow, but I just wanted to point out...um. NASA is tweeting about Sharknado."
Looking forward to Sharknado 3 tomorrow. Tara cant act her way out of a paper bag and her face can no longer show ANY emotion. I LOVE it!
"Loved the Today Show peeps on 3rd installment of ""Sharknado""!! @TODAYshow   @SharknadoFans"
Make sure to watch Sharknado 3 Hell No tomorrow! @maryse0uellet is in the movie! but you'll have to find her ;)
"May I be excused? ""To do what?"" ""So I can watch Sharknado?"" ""... Thank you for being honest."" My 11-year-old sister is cooler than me."
My brother's reaction to the end of Sharknado may be the single greatest thing i have ever witnessed. #epic
"My kids look forward to the Sharknado movies, because they are awesomely horrible....and we need April! #AprilLives"
My mom is really lecturing me about how Sharknado is such a good movie &amp; that everyone watches it which is why they came out with a 3rd one.
My plans were to Sharknado 1&amp;2 it up for tomorrow's big premiere... But OITNB won. 1/2way thru season 3.. I need more hrs in the day..
"Oh my god, Sharknado in space! This is even cooler the 2nd time! #Sharknado3"
"Oh you know, just making sure my schedule tomorrow allows me to watch SHARKNADO 3"
"Ok. Tonight ""Sharknado 3"", the 25th ""Lavantula"", oh you are so lucky US friends!"
"Our 7th and 8th graders had a blast at the ""Sharknado"" Back-to-School dance last night!!"
"Really has to start watching the Sharknado movies now. They'e already on 3 and announcing a 4th movie, and I have yet to see even 1 /o\"
"Really, this Sharknado cast may be the. Best since Boogie Nights."
SHARKNADO 3 tomorrow!??? Best day of my life
SHARKNADO TONIGHT!!! OHMYGOD I AM SO EXCITED even though I can't watch it til Saturday...
Sharknado 3 may be the best film I've seen yet. #Sharknado3 #America
Sharknado 3 may have been the best one
Sharknado 3 may have just slid its way into my top 5 movies

"Sharknado is the best movie ever, but April has got to go. #AprilDies"
Sharknado triple feature tonight...Lavalantula with Police Academy star on Saturday!!!  Scyfy channel is on fire!
Sharknado's on!!! Then the 2nd one! Then #ohhellno #3 at 9. Shoulda left work early.

Sharknado3 tomorrow night! The original Sharknado is on tonight at 9:00 in case you've been living under a rock. Only on Syfy #BestMovieEver
So I notice on SyFy website you can vote if April lives or dies in Sharknado 4. Essentially they announced Shaknado 4... What a great day!
So... Uh guys. Sharknado is tomorrow. Would anyone wanna celebrate it with me on WadaTwitter
Sorry I can't make it in to work tomorrow got caught in a SHARKNADO
Stop what you're doing. Sharknado is on syfy channel. And Sharknado 3 premieres tomorrow night. Life is good
Think I may have fallen in love with @CassieScerbo only 30 minutes into Sharknado 1 ha.

This may be pathetic but I'm soo excited for Sharknado 3. Best to watch with lil kids tho.
Tricking my mom into watching Sharknado and Sharknado 2: The Second One before the party tomorrow night #Sharknado3
Wanna watch Sharknado 3 but I've yet to see Sharknado 1 or 2! So I'll watch those 2 before I watch the 3rd movie!
Wasn't gonna watch Sharknado tonight but I may have to catch a peak to see @keselowski @joeylogano and the @NASCAR crew

What Ebert said about the FRIDAY THE 13th series is actually true of SHARKNADO: whatever you say about one can stand for all of them.

"Yes, Sharknado 4 Is Happening: Sharknado 3 had barely premiered Wednesday night before the studio annou... http://t.co/cOFUH1T4Gv (Time)"

Upset that the publishing company is acting like Go Set a Watchman is a new book.. really it's just the 1st draft of To Kill a Mockingbird
Wait - Go Set A Watchman is really the 1st draft of Mockingbird? Then why is it being published as a separate novel?

@1DAFSanta  well they believed the sun when it talks shit about ZAYN but now the sun is the ultimate liar.
"@1DInsideReport haven't you heard, Zayn an Louis got married in Thailand. Just ask The Sun"
@1DZiamNews  and i can see  Zayn's long eyelashes in what looks like sun rays above the wing...
"@1DZiamNews liam got 29 tattooed on on his body, zayn left on the 25th, there are 4 members left, therefore ziam is real."
@1ddms Hello do you have a dm with Zayn? I am looking for it since forever...may help me?
@BasicallyPayne_ @Real_Liam_Payne ok... First thing first.. U gotta know the statement wasn't made by Zayn but management and the sun
@ElleDevin @musicnews_shade @zaynmalik that's why Pierrie and Zayn are so pale. They haven't been seeing the sun bc they've been so shady
@HeySarah_xo Syco/Columbia have OT5 signed for 5 albums and a greatest hits. That means Zayn has to work on the 5th album or else he breaks+
@JanaehMariscal 2nd person didn't respond. Zayn is gone but do u want Calum?
@LukeKorns then you would be so good that they would ask you to be there 5th member and you would mend there broken hearts after Zayn left
@Nadene_Sewellxx I know what you mean my bday was on the 17th Zayn left on the 25
"@NiallOfficial zayn left on the 25th, school starts on the 25th, the 25th is just not a good day"
@OfficialWith1D no offense but zayn left on the 25th an my organs are on the g r o u  n d
@OneDrecti0nFans what gonna happen tomorrow with Zayn?
@Perfection7 I believe Zayn's return is due for Jan so he'll probably be at the Rumble. No idea what they'll do with Hideo.
@aharryuser @paulstanworth either way its probably true rmbr when the sun said zayn was leaving and we laughed and then zayn left
@brighteyedpezza Hold on the source that said Zayn dumped perrie over text was also the sun and 99% of LM fans believe it!
@camrenspoetry zayn left on the 25th. i guess i should have added 1d BUT
@daggeredxrose all I'm thinking about is how zayn left on March 25TH rip
@danwootton and March is a funny month considering that will be the year anniversary since Zayn left
@frankoniaz actually now they're all denying they ever believed the sun when it came to Zayn.....not even they can keep up with their BS
@h0ranc0cain7 I had to drop a finger cause Zayn is gone and it was like March 25th all over again.
"@honestfandom The sun is shit in general! they made up bad thing about Zayn, the baby news, Harry and 'X' girl every day, homophobic Liam"
@idiot_vibez They didn't believe the Sun for a single second about Louis becoming a dad but they believe the Sun on anything to do with Zayn
@itvthismorning was it strange filming for the 1st time without Zayn?  #1D
@ljpzayn I just don't believe the Sun bc louis and Zayn said not to so I'm not believing anything until they confirm it
@ollyofficial @TheXFactor Your mate should got through. After all he could sing look at Zayn When he 1st auditioned. X
"@presidents If that's true then Zayn hasn't left the band so you're okay. Wait till March, life might fall apart, sry"
@rnbzrince lol remember Zayn's old tweet that said to watch out for august 21st that's what we're joking about
@tvmblrgcrl you think she's ugly only because Zayn may be dating her.Most y'all judge them bc you want to be the one dating Zayn or whatever
@worthybieber No. The Sun is notorious for making up bullshit about Zayn including the cheating allegations.
@xguccilou may be they dont wanna hurt the fans with zayn's pic with the boys!
@xlotsoflouisx me too but Zayn was just on a break at 1st too so idk I'm still super scared
@zhnllexposed It was a Article saying that Zayn is regretting leaving 1 direction pretty much bashing Zayn like the SUN Always does
All of these commercials about Zayn in the vmas... we may never know until Sunday
"All the boys tweeted Liam For the b-day apart from Zayn, C'mon @zaynmalik WE WANT 4/4 #HappyBirthdayLiam #Ziam http://t.co/WpQa6e3M5A"
And they're gonna do a joke where someone from the cast tries to take Zayn's spot and I'm going to laugh angrily  https://t.co/qPzjThwYNG
Auzzie is really proud of being the 2nd person to comment on zayn's nipples when that cover came out lol
"But whatever The Sun says ( well most) come out true  And most media said Zayn will leave, he did  Baby rumours are confirmed by Louis"
Casually drops this in memory of Zayn since the 1st MV w/o him dropped yesterday #DragMeDownMusicVideo https://t.co/rWndyr7Zcy
Changed my field hockey number from 5 to 4 bc Zayn left but if the unthinkable happens this March I guess I'm gonna be number 0
"Did you hear about Zayn leaving One Direction ""That's so March 25th dad"""
Do u ever cry over ZAYN for a lite and then it seems like March all over again bc same
"Funny how people believe the sun when it's about Zayn, though, isn't it lol f u"
Had a full conversation about Zayn leaving One Direction with my education professor in front of the whole class today. Happy Wednesday
Hollywire tv wtf wednesday talking about zayn's twitter feud is quite relevant
I can't believe tomorrow im seeing the loml's again for the 3rd time but Zayn won't be there and I didn't even think about that.
I don't think ZAYN is getting enough sun no wonder he hasn't tweeted yet
"I find it's hilarious. Directioners use 22, I mean Taylor song and anything related with the MV to celebrate Zayn's 22nd bday."
I hope Zayn isn't hanging out with May because she's been trying to start shit with his life for years.
I hope they're not suggesting calvin and Zayn fighting because let's face it...Zayn may be tiny but he's got fast hands
"I met Harry, Liam and Niall on 26 March, the day right after Zayn announced he's leaving, the boys looked heartbroken #5monthswithoutzayn"
"I opened this account on March 25th when Zayn left, since then I've meet some amazing people who share the same love with 1D."
"I really don't want to believe the sun but i after Zayn's leaving and all the drama, I just can't help but think if it's true"
"I really want Justin to take a picture with Kendall,Miley,Ariana and Zayn on Sunday"
"I still have trust issues towards Zayn's Instagram. Yes, it may be his, but I really don't think he's the one posting it."
I still remember like 3 years ago.  Zayn told Harry that he was leaving the band on February 30th but he was joking and he said Harry cried+
I think the boys may have thinking about Zayn at the #OTRAPhiladelphia when they sang Fresh Prince Bel Air
"I visited zayn's twitter and i saw "" 21st of august watch it out girls :)"" and suddenly gone and it return to his first tweet wtf"
"I will give more solo dm with Zayn tomorrow, so stay active and turn notifs on. :) x"
I'm dreading all the press tomorrow saying Hair is about Zayn when IT WAS WRITTEN WAY BEFORE THEY BROKE UP
I'm gonna listen to I don't mind then allow zayn's departure to sink in for the 700th time since march 25th
I'm surprised it took this long after Zayn left for this to happen.  https://t.co/6mEm3A3ala
If I see Zayn on Sunday I think I will pass the fuck out !
"If the rumours I'm hearing are true, this next batch of NXT hires may actually be better than the ""NXT Kliq""(Owens,Balor,Itami,Zayn,Neville)"
If you ever wanna believe The Sun just remeber that they once wrote about Zayn and Louis secretly getting married in Thailand...
If you would have told 7th grade Eleni that I would go see one direction in America without Zayn.. I'd probably think that you were lying
Imagine Zayn comes out on the 2nd part of CFMF
Is anyone else reading that Zayn may be performing at the VMAs with The Weeknd? I'm not emotionally ready for that.
Is it true that Zayn might be performing tomorrow at the VMAS
It remind me to Zayn when he said there's one missing #MTVHottest One Direction https://t.co/5c4AESCjMJ
It was nice of @onedirection to break this news on a Sunday and not while I'm sitting at work like they did with Zayn. That was rude.
It's like when Zayn said he was just taking a break all over again.. https://t.co/YiNXGYgIlX
It's the 21st of August istg if the reason why Zayn isn't tweeting is because he's got something in store for us in this specific day....
It's the 5th pic Zayn posted today.... he posted this on FB  ok man r u gonna kill me http://t.co/kJJhH3sdEY
Its the 1st video without zayn and its still perf #DragMeDownMusicVideo
Just realized that on my 18th bday everyone will be like hashtag 1 year since Zayn left and I'll just be sitting in my room crying like tf
Liam's tattoo has the number 25 Zayn left on March 25 I'm not saying ziam is real &amp; alive but ziam is real &amp; alive http://t.co/S27yRBIMdo
"Liams new tattoo is the number 25, do you know when Zayn left? March 25th so that must mean...  Ziam is real."
March 15: media frenzy over the Ziam kiss  March 25: Zayn quits one direction.  Y'ALL REALLY GONNA SAY THIS ISNT WEIRD ?
"March 25 : OTRA Jakarta, my OTRA March 25 : Zayn officially left 1D  see the struggle?! #5monthswithoutzayn"
"March 28 will be the first One Direction's concert without Zayn as member. They'll sing at a sold out stadium, over 90,000 fans!"
Maria thinks Harry is gonna leave the band in January and collab with Zayn on like 5 albums  and then maybe works with naughty boy same
Must stop Zayn at all costs from going  https://t.co/kwpX3ZHvFq
"OMG.OMG. can't wait guys,it's tomorrow!Don't think about how Zayn's not there.It's his fault,not ours!Remember that. #DragMeDownMusicVideo"
Photoset: thepalmtoptiger: Are we going to talk about the fact that Zayn has the sun/sunray motif on his... http://t.co/i9ffAS6FQk
"Premonition: Zayn is going to drop a song today or tomorrow, God willing.  Sorry @LovelessWords"
Remember how Zayn left the band on my 18th birthday :/ #5monthswithoutzayn
"SOPHOMORES!If you plan on coming to float building come to Sam Crain's house Sunday at 2!!  Contact any stuco member, Zayn, Emilie, or Bella"
"Saturday Links: Teen President Edition: Plus One Direction's first music video without Zayn, stream the new Be... http://t.co/jl6IlHMunb"
"School starts tomorrow and I'm still sad AF about Zayn, Louis is a dad and now this tf #OneDirection"
"See you guys will go on the defense when the sun says ANYTHING about 1D, but they say something about Zayn ya'll believe in a heartbeat wtf"
"Since Midnight Memories, I knew that Zayn will be the 1st to left, I watched almost all of their performance &amp; Zayn is not that into them."
Someone on my TL just tweeted that Liam is the 2nd oldest member of 1D nd I was about to correct her before I remembered that Zayn quit
"Sometimes I forget Zayn left one direction, and then when the realisation hits and it's 25th March all over again"
Soo apparently I've been dared by @Silvana76429890 to not talk about the boys or Zayn for a whole day tomorrow I can't even rt them or anyth
Tbh. Drag me down music video was so good that I didn't notice Zayn was missing until the 4th time I watched it
"The Sun has been trying to push this whole ""End of 1D"" mantra since Zayn left so they can get credit for being the first to say it"
The Sun is bullshit 99% of the time but they're the ones who said Louis is gonna be a dad and Zayn left and look what happened
The sun look more hurt about zerries break up than zayn and Perrie
Their first music video without Zayn and it may just be their best one yet. #DragMeDownVevoRecord
Thought the boys taking a break will allow me concentrate on my school lessons ha. Forgot ZAYN IS OUT THERE ZOLO &amp; MAY DROP A SINGLE ANYTIME
Throwback Thursday to when I did a powerpoint in journalism on Zayn and presented it to the class
"Tomorrow at school: ""Why did Zayn and Perrie break up?""  ""Is sophiam engaged?"" ""Did you guys break the record?"" Me: http://t.co/x5egIYa88c"
Tomorrow marks 5 months since ZAYN left the band can everybody like post videos of their reactions
UNSEEN || Picture of Zayn with his family on August 29th!! http://t.co/pMfNl3EYmv
Uh how is Zayn gonna party with Liam tomorrow when he's still in LA? I don't think that's what the pap was taking about
Vma's might be using Zayn for promo or may be he is actually going.
Wait but when Zayn left we got a Facebook statement now the whole band is separating and we don't get anything just an article from the sun
Well...looks like One Direction has finally decided to end the standoff. Thanks for the free Zayn promo though! https://t.co/NHdmdhDpY2
What are The Sun trying to say about Zayn?... http://t.co/JGUxGGxlnR
"Whelp, I get to go see One Direction perform tomorrow.  I saw them with Zayn and now I get to see them without him."
"When Zayn sees niall bc N always changes subject when he gets questioned about Z, so he talks about their 5th album https://t.co/myxAUDmpir"
When they sing the chorus all together after Zayn's 2nd solo in 18 is where it all goes down hill
"When you claim to see the sun light, but it turns out to be a flashlight. Just bc Zayn left doesn't mean they'll break up. #OhNoTheSun"
When you feel like Zayn is going to follow you soon and end of the day you're like well maybe tomorrow
Who does Louis hate more Zayn or Harry the world may never know
Why do you spread lies? Zayn still has his IG https://t.co/Lz24k3lXF7
Why is May Vaseline talking about Zayn like they're best friends?
Why would the sun publish such a big announcement of 1D splitting up and not like what they did with Zayn on FB?
Wouldnt 1D have posted a facebook statement first like what they did with Zayn? This is big news and it's just being reported by The Sun
"Yeah, everything is Zayn's fault.Even if we get a hurricane tomorrow, it's gonna be Zayn's fault.u guys r disgusting https://t.co/edsHJw7q0t"
ZAYN is part of the illuminati #confirmed  https://t.co/iYbkdp15rZ
"Zain Javadd ""Zayn"" Malik (born 12 January 1993) is an English singer&amp;songwriter &amp; former member of the boyband One Di http://t.co/ZRVvY2kBPy"
"Zain Javadd ""Zayn"" Malik born 12 January 1993) is an English singer and songwriter, and a former member of the boy band One Direction-"
Zayn and Justin are both working in the studio. What if they're planning a secret collab? The world may never know! Stay tuned . . .
Zayn deleted his Instagram and the last time he tweeted was the 18th of August this is hell http://t.co/FGgI7ny65N
"Zayn is back in LA - he was seen leaving The Warwick in Hollywood last night, August 26 http://t.co/nLv0jUri3e"
Zayn is currently unverified on Instagram! It may be due to the glitch. https://t.co/aGKeihuPtv
Zayn just may be in London. Spending time with the fam before he makes the move to LA
Zayn left the band on Wednesday The last Canadian show is on a wednesday My first day of school is wednesday   I OFFICIALLY HATE WEDNESDAYS
Zayn may be performing at the #VMAs  Im not ready
"Zayn may have left, but the boys do such an amazing job covering his parts.. #EMABiggestFans1D http://t.co/MpWkSRznko"
"Zayn's ""how it goes but I know"" in the 2nd BSE chorus is pure sex."
Zayn's family have their last day in LA. They will be leaving tomorrow.
"Zayn's hair is dark in the 1st and last Insta post but in the middle, his hair is silver..."
also if they were gonna break up why didn't they just do so in march when zayn left wheres the logic
don't think I'm gonna watch the VMAs cause the boys aren't on and if Zayn performs I can see it later. plus school tomorrow and I like sleep
hmm if the March thing is true he probably meant that it's unfortunate not have Zayn around until then https://t.co/mfbzPK2kSt
how much you wanna bet zayn will come online today or tomorrow
i have no idea what's going on but why IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT LIAM AND ZAYN?! will zayn attend the vmas?! it's liam's birthday tomorrow!!!
i remember when zayn left i took down all my posters and sat in my 1d blanket with 1d headphones in and stared at my blank wall crying
i'm gonna do this with zayn's face https://t.co/XQ53qzquJS
if they really gonna disband it means that I was right when I thought Simon is lying in those interviews after Zayn left.  The Sun
"ok, i am fixing to rant about Zayn and @Harry_Styles sorry to those that get upset.  1st, dont get me wrong, Zayn is hot af but is this +"
still not over the strange premonition of the last Q of Rolling Stone's Lost Q&amp;A w/ Zayn that they published March 25 http://t.co/JUyhRoq340
that time they were all wasted at the brits and louis sat in zayn's lms if u agree https://t.co/ikvZEkT3I9
the boys apart of harry actually talked to us about the hiatus when zayn gave a subtle interview to the sun then left twitter for two weeks
the sun is so stupid they know how much the boys mean to everyone and they knew how hard it was for us when zayn left this is so disgusting
what if the boys tweet Zayn on january 12th. Or worse...what if they DONT tweet him on january 12th. either way im dead. I lose once again
when The Sun says 1D is gonna split yall get mad but when they said Zayn ended Zerrie with a text yall believe it ok
why did u fave calvins tweet to zayn when you shaded taylor Hella hard december 16th 2012 at 8:17pm eastern time? @louis_tomlinson
why don't ot4 stans ever remember zayn's interview with the sun
zayn will be sat with his mum now probably cooking and talking and annoying his little sisters and I want to be there to see it bye
" Zayn is a detective who may or may not have a thing for Liam, aw aw aw detective zayn with a thing for doctor liam would be so cute"
1D stans gonna blame Zayn for this .. just wait #WeMissYourVoiceZayn  https://t.co/Shsnn3guCl

@zjmandjdb May be Chris knows that Zayn is gonna be the bigger star than him..:)
@zjmcartoon You started with tweeting 'who cares' and this is so stupid bc i bet when Zayn will show us his 1st song/video you will care +
A day without Zayn is like a year without sun https://t.co/vjZHNAAntr
"At the Chicago concert on June 2, Liam and Zayn ripped off Harry's shirt in the middle of his WMYB solo. It was a beautiful moment."
"But this is Wednesday something should happen with Zayn!  @zaynmalik make something happen, were dying here"
Convinced my sister that Zayn will appear in the background of the #DragMeDownMusicVideo  if she watches it 20+ times This is her 6th view
"Everybody gets happy around Zayn. People get happy, puppies get happy, the sun gets brighter, the nature gets more beautiful"
Excuse me but when did the march ended? i still rememberyself laughing when zayn left i want the old days back
First we got Doniya and now Trisha. I'm waiting for Zayn with Waliyha and Yasser so I can fly my ass to thee sun.

Harry is so cute and I love them all and I love DMD but I can't help crying watching #DragMeDownMusicVideo the 1st time bc Zayn's not there.
Holy fuck if i meet Zayn on Sunday I'm just not gonna do anything for the rest of my life.
"However, I may or may not have shed a tear since it was the first video without Zayn #DragMeDownMusicVideo @onedirection"
I am still yet to see Zayn's full fledged smile with his tongue between his teeth after March :( #ZquadWantsZaynToSmile
I can't wait for Zayn tomorrow when he just attend the VMAS it's going to be fire.
I got a solo DM with Zayn in July- I missed him in LA in August- He follows me 2 days later- He unRTed my art- My account is gone. Wonderful
I guess Zayn is going to be at the VMA's tomorrow and I gotta go to bed so I can prepare myself. ZAYN WILL BE ON MY TV AGHH!!
"I had a dream I talked to zayn and harry, we were at the concert &amp; zayn was there to see the boys, then harry sat on my lap and danced WHAT"
I had my eyes closed already to go to sleep. but I always check a notif to see if it's Zayn and well https://t.co/zZKHkfnMKI
"I just sat here, watching videos of Zayn. I never realized that I miss him this much."
I love how the video came out august 21st. Zayn is always making his presence known.
"I may have been mad for a day,but I'm so proud of Zayn now"
I swear if Zayn performs tomorrow  at the vmas I am not prepared mentally or physically
I sweeeaaaaarrrrr if Zayn is on the red carpet tomorrow at the vma's I'm gonna jump out my fucking window
I'M SO SERIOUS. January is 5 months away so I thought everyone was talking about Zayn's birthday. https://t.co/9OyV9MZJoE
I'm going to bed knowing that there is a possibility that I may wake up to videos and pictures of Zayn performing at the VMA's
"I'm not 100% sure but if everything goes like it always does, something is gonna happen with zayn tomorrow, preferably zayn drops a single."
"I'm only excited for the VMAs because Zayn may go, if he doesn't I'll cry"
I'm really just wondering if this would've happened if Zayn was still in the group https://t.co/nLfHAjrndc
Im just so happy that Zayn is fully living his thotty dteams on this Tuesday morning. Also my hamgover is mild. #Blessed
It's Sunday but zayn's performance makes me want to pop off
It's hard to see Zayn up there bc he look like the sun #zayngetofftheroof

"Stephen Hawking said ""This girl may like to know that in another possible universe, she and Zayn are happily married."""
Still waiting for the day I wake up to Zayn still being in the band and realising everything after March 25th was just a dream
The boys have this Christmas concert in San Jose in Dec. that I might go to...I feel like Zayn will be back in the band by then
They are absolutely blind to Zayn's good nature. Use lame excuses to hate on him bc they just bitter still.  https://t.co/b7iDCP3NTi

Zayn deserves so much to be happy. I'd trade the moon for the sun if that could make him happy
Zayn is my 5th most played artist. I just wanted to clarify this b4 I'm accused of bandwagoning when he blows up
Zayn is the only reason that I might watch the VMAs tomorrow
Zayn may be an asshole but he's cute and nice deep inside
Zayn may have left the band but i will still support him no matter what cs hes still the 1D zayn i love and i always will
Zayn reminds me of Rih. This may be blasphemous to say but I feel like he's about to be a male version of her which is good
"Zayn still looks ethereal, the world is still revolving, the sun still shines bright. Nobody cares :) https://t.co/Wdvp0rgUY6"
Zayn was like c'mon then c'mon putting his head close to me like when you're going to have a fight then he just leaned forward &amp; kissed me
Zayn's departure marked the beginning of the end... #RIP #youwillbemissed #1D https://t.co/av4JzrBNNB
Zayn's roller coaster is the most emotional of all emotional roller coasters https://t.co/Z5pTo3uoY6
