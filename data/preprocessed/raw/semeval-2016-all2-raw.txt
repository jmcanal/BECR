On 2nd thought, the NX rumors don't completely make sense because Nintendo is already planning smartphone games
@jrconway3 @BitnerdGX Sure, it may not be in a direct sense. But Nintendo gives GX the support by sending them coverage and press releases.
I admit Nintendo may have gone a bit overboard with the whole "lets give all the popular youtubers a copy of super mario maker" thing
@xchadillacx it comes out NOV 13 if it does come out.  Nintendo is notorious for rumors trust me ha
I find it interesting that 3rd party collector's edition don't sell out. Nintendo is a different story.

There is a certain cult classic game, the 3rd in its series, that we have been waiting for in the US but Nintendo refuses to release it
Honestly, lack of 3rd party support should have been expected. its not the company's fault for not siding with Nintendo
@ZeroSHEARER @ZhugeEX again an improvement. I don't like barely any Nintendo first party exclusives. It's ALL about 3rd party on all systems
@THEREALRTU but then I suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe Nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... Lol
@16KTS @Flareonys Nintendo needs some more 3rd party reps, but at the same time that's what makes them pure.

My long shot dream announcement tomorrow from Apple: Apple TV video games include a partnership with Nintendo.
@BlazeRuler Nintendo may have wanted to make it E10+, so they left him out. I dunno, probably not true
@JediPrince84 I bought Rayman Legends just to have some simple fun. I can't wait for Nintendo to sink and become a 2nd/3rd party developer
It would be poetic if Nintendo became a Sony 2nd Party Developer. It would also make choosing consoles every generation very easy
Apparently Super Mario Maker comes out on the 11th of September. I guess it's Nintendo's way of saying "just bloody rebuild them already".
Can't believe Nintendo is finally allowing it. Wow. Pretty excited for Afterbirth too. Might actually buy it for PC. https://t.co/kGrvFkWAyJ

If Cena ties Ric Flair's 16th World Titles, that will truly be a slap in the face of Flair. Ridiculous #RAW
*whispers* Ric Flair is at least a seventeen time World Champion. John Cena won't tie him if he wins on Sunday.

Maybe the 2nd Monster was a bad idea in hindsight. Feel more amped up than Ric Flair on speed.

Rick Perry may be the first to drop out. Out of money.  http://t.co/zwmnwXbH0J #GOP2016
I think a big part of Rick Perry's fall is simply that he is not a sitting governor this time around. May be Jeb's downfall too.
Rick Perry may have to drop out of the race, before one vote is cast, because he has run out of money. I have mixed feelings about that.
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump -How could anyone (Other than Megyn Kelly) compare Rick Perry with Trump? C'mon. Perry is a joke.
May be Rick Perry wishes he would have answered question he was asked 5 times in 24 hours on fox what would u do with 11 million illegals?
Rick Perry said he was the Zar of stopping illegals sat there and glossed himself for 2 months how he could secure the border not 1 idea11 m

I think Sarah Palin may have a health issue . I had a hyper - active thyroid and I still can't remember all of the odd things I said &amp; did.

@simonbalac @Yordydonald @ABC BAD example she worked Th since January(&amp;her mom worked there4 35 yrs) BEFORE SCOTUS gave homos special rights
@magicalvidyacat Seems fitting that there's a parallel there, and that SCOTUS used 14th Amendment to override the 10th. @Rinaxas
You say it's not a right. SCOTUS says it is. Constitution says we follow SCOTUS. Fucking done! https://t.co/iyANr58fvq
@PoliticalLaughs @kesgardner Besides I don't believe that SCOTUS has the power to overturn state marriage laws per the 10th amendment

Suggestion - get familiar with 1ST Amendment.  it pretty much strikes down all SCOTUS rulings regarding gay marriage, holiday celebrations
@littlebytesnews I never said it is. But the SCOTUS ruled that the 14th Amendment requires a state to license a marriage of same sex couples
@politibunny @brakinggnus @dangoddu @jbryant710 SCOTUS violated the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution not allowing #KimDavis #1A right
@israel4911 @Letha_Hughes It was the 14th that SCOTUS ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality. News not your strong subject.
@GuyScott33 14TH AMENDMENT guarantees EQUAL PROTECTION so yeah. Oh &amp;, P.S., no, SCOTUS didn't write the law but DID correctly interpret it.
@LeeAdams_4Him purpose of the SCOTUS is to establish constitutionality of laws. they ruled that gay marriage bans violated 14th amend rights
@A10Jim @ninaland @WoodhullSFA And that's why SCOTUS has the last word on what laws states may enact and enforce. Hence "Supreme Court."
.@tonyortegamusic @MagDods @rachelheldevans SCOTUS ruled that the 14th amendment applies to same sex marriage.
The SCOTUS claimed under the 14th amendment they could make the same sex marriage ruling. No matter how far you stretch it isn't there.
@Billd111 @megynkelly @tedcruz SCOTUS has determined that the 14th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens
@SniffJenkum SCOTUS has no authority to make law. Only Congress may legislate. #SeparationOfPowers #AbuseOfPower
@cspanwj In their recent pro gay marriage decision, SCOTUS has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the United States Constitution.
Clerk #KimDavis is jailed because SCOTUS can see Gay Marriage in the 14th Amend. but Fed.Dist.Judge can't see religious freedom in the 1st.
1A: Congress can't make law preventing religious freedom, so SCOTUS interpretation unlawful Const Trumps case law https://t.co/f4LSUd5ENR
the kim davis case is just a sample of what's coming  to gun owners when SCOTUS decides it wants to redefine the 2nd amend

@LarryOConnor @GretchenCarlson U sound like the hated "smartset" now? Is #KimDavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from SCOTUS in history?
Huckabee claims SCOTUS made new law on SSM. No. The equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment is more than a century old.
SCOTUS cannot make law only rule on it. Get real America.  Unless it's healthcare.Then they feel they can.    https://t.co/IyMH2Hbe09
SCOTUS Apparently is Saying That Gays Have an Equal Right to Marriage Under the 14th Amendment.
Ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman, if SCOTUS now writes law, guess Ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish.
all you gun owner better get ready B/C the next thing SCOTUS will be redefining is the 2nd amend

I'm finding my life and the dialogue around me are right out of a Seinfeld episode. Many of you may think this is fun, but it's unnerving.

Won't be live tweeting the vma's tonight despite what you may have guessed. Watching Seinfeld instead. Thank you.

Interested to see what kind of ratings the U.S. Open final gets on Saturday with Serena presumably going for history up against CFB.
I'm pretty sure Serena ripped that match winning ace the same time USMNT game up their 3rd.
And with Serena's 11th ace she wins the match vs her sister Venus
History still in the making with Serena's win over sister Venus! #GrandSlam https://t.co/p56xxav8vv

Serena reaches her 7th semifinals of the #USOpen in a row. Two more matches to complete the Grand Slam.
@hbryant42 Venus missed so many neutral shots in 3rd set that she never let Serena feel the pressure; she let her off the hook, in a way.
One of the most beautiful moments in tennis history! Nice hug! Serena defeats Venus in their 27th face-to-face... http://t.co/GPtPn3SWvO

Serena is emotionally drained. Hope she has time to rest up before Thursday.

Serena be lettin oponents comeback in the 2nd set just to make the media feel better. That good #SerenaVsVenus
Sisterly love: After beating older sis Venus in 3rd set match at @usopen, Serena says, "She's the best person I know." (Cc:@alexa_pollock)
What's weird is Serena and Venus are a train ride away right now but I feel like they are goddesses who live on the sun
Serena may have taken that match, but Venus wins.  So much class.  Just a good person. The same cannot be said about her sister.  #veealways
@AlexSanderNYC How can you give people tips to better their lives when u just sat on here slandering Serena over her body? #GetAGripSir
"@SportsCenter: Serena remains on top! The younger Williams bts Venus in the sisters' 14th GS matchup, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. http://t.co/Bl2LdYsQ9c
I'm man enough to admit that I proudly couldn't handle Serena's back shot. Babygirl may have the skrongest thigh/a$$ muscles in the world
Can't take disrespect ppl show Venus! She's the 2nd best in women's draw-wins a set off Serena &amp; ppl say it's fixed. Such BS #SerenavsVenus

@ArleneNKelly and you will be procrastinating to see Serena make history on sunday?
Serena dominated in the end, a tough match for the win! https://t.co/QHjXSFz4Bi
Know what's scary? Serena was mildly injured a little after Wimbledon and sat out before the US Open.  She could win with that formula.
I feel Serena let Venus win the 2nd set
@NerdyWonka @terri_georgia My feeling Serena could win 2 straight set, but as a respect2 Venus and viewers she let Venus 2win 2nd set

@OsoFreshFutbol I think the expectations are so low in Avatar land it may be a sleeper. Star Wars land is going to be tough to do right.
Letting your professors know not to schedule a final on December 17th and 18th because That's the Star Wars premiere....Yeah, I'm that kid
#ForceFriday as a whole was pretty disappointing. Not sure who dropped the ball - retailers, Hasbro, or Disney. It's Star Wars! C'mon!
Toy collectors &amp; Star Wars Fans may the force guide you to my store to find the Droid you are looking for! #BB8 http://t.co/PzqtbxSmYA

can it be December 18th already? I just wanna watch Star Wars: The Force Awakens
4 yr old who attended Saturday's Star Wars event came in today to tell me he made 4 new friends that day. #childrenslibrarian #lovemyjob
December 16 &amp; 17 will be the best two consecutive days ever. NXT Takeover live in London and then Star Wars
there's not really anyone I know irl that gets passionate enough about Star Wars I need to find new friends before dec 18th
Finishing Jurassic park for like the 100th time tomorrow. Film class is gonna have a lot of reruns for me. All the batman films, Star Wars..
@Pillownaut 1978. I missed Star Wars and Saturday Night Fever but made it in time for Grease, so there's that.
Who wants to go see Star Wars ep 7 with me in December?
I have a Star Wars themed birthday party this Saturday. But here's the downside..
When we go over expectations, I make it fun with Star Wars-- the Jedi Code of Conduct. http://t.co/67J9CcUea5 #sdu46
Just discovered the complete first season of Star Wars rebels is available for free On Demand. Tomorrow's work day just got AWESOME.
Can December 17th get here any faster? I want to watch Star Wars already
@rebelrealcanon Nothing wrong with that. I was in 4th grade when Episode I was released. I'd seen the OT before, but TPM is my Star Wars!
UK release of Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens to be a day earlier than expected (Dec 17) http://t.co/ImqpET9gWd
Now the UK release of Star Wars: The Force Awakened has been brought forward to our 10th wedding anniversary, my wife might take the hint?
There is no perhaps when it comes to Star Wars! You MUST! May the power of the force compel you to do so! https://t.co/RmcfH2TmqF

He's still wrong about Sting :) https://t.co/SgqnnXStdZ
Sting will interfere and cost Undertaker the match this sunday. Or, it's possible we could see the return of the masked Kane. #SummerSlam
Sting defeat the @GoderichGrizz 9-4 ... On to fullarton tomorrow night to face the @FullartonAs
Ich habe ein @YouTube-Video positiv bewertet: http://t.co/4njhci2kuC Sting saves Randy Orton from the Authority: WWE Raw, March 16,
@AnsoniiSan thanks brother I feel the same she's a fighter! She loves Sting so I'm going to ask him to sign a card for her Saturday lol
Preaching theme this Sunday: David &amp; Bathsheba -- with band doing cover of Sting's "Every Breath U Take (I'll be watching U)" #yeahbaby
Retweet/Favorite if you want to see Masked Kane, Sting and The Rock return this Sunday at #SummerSlam! #WWEFamily http://t.co/coY9ouWlMj
Sting's in Brooklyn. Sunday night, it's happening. IT'S HAPPENING! #SummerSlam
[150823 Moo Party] Mamamoo sang Sting with live piano 1st then back to MR. Pictures/fanarts/messages from MooMoos were shown on the screen.
If Sting is on RAW tomorrow then there is no doubt he will confront The Undertaker to build towards a match at WrestleMania.
@lentzadam533 yea definitely but I just saw a report that Sting is coming to RAW tomorrow and Taker going be at raw could be interesting
Rumor has it that Sting will appear on #RAW tomorrow night.
@Danielmmafan Sting could always have another match before. I just read hes gonna be on Raw tomorrow.
Sting will be on RAW tomorrow though so that should set up the taker/Sting match
@FredRichani If you wanna do Rock vs Brock and Taker vs Sting at wm 32. Survivor Series on his 25th anniversary would be the place to end it
Rumor Roundup (Aug. 24, 2015): Raw tonight, WrestleMania, Sting return, Divas Revolution, more! http://t.co/VRDROEKt0E via @cagesideseats.
Looking forward to Monday Night Raw, I have a feeling we'll be seeing Ric Flair in the ring with Sting tonight! #WWERaw #WCW
And it all ends,  with Sting! Monday Night Raw, was absolutely, WAY more better, then Summerslam. #StingVsRollins  #RawBrooklyn
That was one of the best Monday Night Raw shows I've seen in a while, finishing off with Sting! Could we see #RollinsvsSting
Including his TNA title wins, Sting is a 14-time World Champion. Beating Seth would tie him with Cena for 2nd of all time. @wwe #raw
great RAW tonight...1st the Dudley Boys and then to end with Sting!!!   #WWERaw #WWE
@DukesWrestling if Sting is in a Rollins story line who's the next rumored 3rd man for Reigns/Ambrose?
Sting winning at #NightOfChampions results in either Sting vs Taker at Mania or Sting vs Cena and I've got a bad feeling it's the 2nd option
Sting is back, and the Dudleys return :D Quite an eventful Monday Night Raw on the whole. Lesnar-Dallas though X'D #RawBrooklyn
@ryan24672 @CMPuLs3 And it'd work, Seth getting the rub and being Sting's 2nd ever opponent + a month long reign with both titles is BIG
@Chrissie32NY so tomorrow we should try &amp; plan a trip to see the next PPV as Sting might be world champ!!
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/zDth0kovNW Seth Rollins vs Sting the Returns 2015 WWE Raw, Aug 24
I honestly think I'm still Marking Out from last night's #RAW... 1st the Dudley Boyz...  Then Ric Flair... And then Sting!! :D #WWE
STING vs. Seth Rollins on September 20th for the World Title! Amazing! http://t.co/xoNwHr5Syx
@NickGator well, at least you can see Sting's 1st WWE title win for only 9.99
One issue I had with the Sting stuff, But it also supporting one of my theories during Mania... http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW
C'mon, Vince...we're not stupid.  We all know Sting's going to job to Rollins to make him look strong.
Loving the Sting stuff &amp; especially loving the way Triple sold it all... STING WAS IN THE BOX! http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW
The Sting stuff just being great &amp; loving how Triple H sold the "big reveal"... http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW

See they should have announced Sting's appearance last Monday beforehand. Say he will address WM and his future. Tease retirement.
@kenjude me and a Daddy Deano went to see Sting and Paul Simon. 4 blokes behind us talked for the 1st 15 mins. Absolute dicks. Why?
BREAKING NEWS: Sting will be at #Raw and open the show this Monday http://t.co/msiFqHPUw5 http://t.co/LecmnWmCFg
ENGLISHMAN IN NEW YORK by STING was no.15 in the UK charts on 29 August 1990 https://t.co/oxFAAR1zxa
My first time seeing #RAW live and Sting opens the show this Monday. Can't wait! #RawTampa  https://t.co/IguQxey9L7
Wonder if Sting will be able to speak with his actual voice on #Raw on Monday, or if they'll dub him over like a movie trailer again.
I hope Sting spends his time at #RAW tomorrow complaining about how long he had to stand behind that curtain while @WWERollins went on &amp; on
@WWE @Sting @USA_Network  WCW guys will not win WWE World title..Sting deserves it but WWE still think it's a Monday night War
That statue's going to be demolished via Sting's bat. https://t.co/ni8VfDd5VK
@KevinLive5 thanks! I know you would have the answer. Hope all is well! I'm sure Sting last Monday had you jacked up with energy!
Sting appears for the 2nd week - Ziggler/Lana face Rusev/Summer - Divas Beat the Clock match to determine #1 contender to title at NOC. #Raw
HERE WE GO Monday Night Raw hopefully we get another good show tonight Sting vs Rollins at NOC should be really good #RAW
What a good way to open Monday Night Raw with Sting, lovin it! #RAW #WWE
Sting opens tonight's #WWE #RAW - Results:   http://t.co/bgtILzw8sV http://t.co/Edbdj4n4xT
I know Sting says this is Monday Night #Raw, but it feels a lot more like Monday Nitro to me
Even if it's an announced segment, I still mark out when Sting is on my TV on Monday nights. #RAW
#StingonRaw what a great way to start off Monday night Raw with Sting!
And @TripleH may have " hand picked " @WWERollins but @StephMcMahon and Sting is right- Rollins is not half the man HHH is. #RAW
He may be 56, but Sting is still as passionate as ever and still has the fire. Still awesome on the mic. He and Rollins will be M-O-N-E-Y.
Going on record, Sting wins belt at NoC, drops it at the MSG show on the 3rd. If I'm wrong, ya can have open season on me.
Sting is on wwe monday night raw tonight http://t.co/cSmiagYDd0
Not that I don't love Seth Rollins, he's gold on the belts. But this may be Sting's only title run sooo #StingOnRaw #RAW #RawTampa
"@AnishJain50: Sting opens Monday night Raw! #StingonRaw" although with a crappy promo. @MrGriffinB #NightOfChampions
Sting and dudley boyz in action tonight. One of the best monday night raws nbs
@jimmykorderas I congratulate you on using Vince logic not because Sting is old he would never let a WCW star win the strap in his 1st year
*Cena and Sting stare from the ramp at Triple H and Seth Rollins* was really a closing to Monday Night Raw y'all. That happened. #RAW
Sting's Opening Promo being literally the perfect example when it comes to how to sell a PPV with a Promo... http://t.co/9IAoMFyqUA #RAW

Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise is another bad ass movie; I have never seen it till now.
Can't wait for The Edge of the Day After Tomorrow, where Tom Cruise gets cold over and over again until he brings down the oil companies.
The Action flick Kings, Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner needs to sharpen this aspect of his acting. He may turn out to be a fine poster boy for it

Idk how I feel about going to darts every Wednesday. Like I'm pretty sure every person there for darts is voting for Trump, but idk.
Why many conservative pundits  R declaring war on Trump. Dec- laring war on the most candid &amp;  'for the people' candidate in  YOUR lifetime!
I hope both the USMNT, and Trump, for that matter, manage to take a huge shit on Mexico.  https://t.co/PJArNl2H5B

@realDonaldTrump @CNN Match the contribution Trump! That'll really show you care, this may come off as a point grab and turn negative.
@matt_mcnult My honest hope right now is that Trump will not receive the GOP nomination and run 3rd party, splitting the GOP vote causing
republicans should check 1st before using songs for their rallies. EyeoftheTiger+Kim Davis=ABSOLUTELY NOT. Same with Trump. #KimDavis
so folks, Trump has now lead consistently nationally and in every key state since beginning of july.  past history shows that wins it all.
As much as I hate to admit, Trump may be right. But he should add #msnbc #foxnews and others into the mix, also. https://t.co/3oQKjV9P4F
That Mexico vs USA commercial with trump gets your blood boiling. Race war October 10th. Imagine that parking lot. Gaddamnnnnnn VIOLENCE!!!
@BretBaier @GovChristie @FoxNews I see grit &amp; fight in you 2nd to Trump. If you were front runner how would you handle the PC media atrack?

Racism towards Latinos has risen since Trump went public with his. White people feeling bolder http://t.co/Vw3AQCegiP

Trump is really a presidential candidate....this is not the longest MTV Awards skit, nor Saturday Night Live or Living Color.  No, really.
This is so important. Trump is playing on the racist fears of white Americans and it's working. https://t.co/UyYAWANW60

It may be the end of the world as we know it, but Trump's feeling fine.
@sherifffruitfly If Trump gets elected, we'll probably see an Ayatollah give a sitting president the middle finger for 1st time in history.
@ESPN1000 @CarmenDeFalco @Jurko64 @DitkasPlace Let's hope he won't mention Trump! C'mon man!
@SusanCucinotta @ChuckNellis Agree. But at least he let Ted go 1st. Was Ted's rally, after all. Still same Trump speech, didn't seem to fit.

This man made up my mind to oppose #Brexit when he told Tsipras to hold his head high #betteroffin https://t.co/G4TFuxOMeM
What makes the 3rd bailout different is that, after Tsipras, there will be no one left inside Greece to credibly manage the memorandum
After all these Tsipras headlines, I wonder if they'll still let the Athens Stock Exchange open tomorrow. Will be a total bloodbath.
Love or hate Tsipras, he's told nothing but the truth since day 1. Wouldn't see honesty like that with other leaders https://t.co/tcHI7WgwAo

Leftist hypocrisy of the day: "The Mail's 'Corbyn's 1st 1000 days' is a viscous smear. Channel 4's 'UKIP's 1st 100 days' was good, though"

@paulwaugh to be fair Paul, after SNP, UKIP, Boundary changes &amp; 50 fewer MPs, it may not be leader that's influencing the 80% who disagree
Buzzfeed asks if UKIP loses votes to Corbyn; Farage thinks he'll pick up some Greens/non-voters but a chunk of old Labour vote may go UKIP.

I still sleep with the teddy bear rob gave me for Valentine's Day my senior year and I'm starting my junior year of college on Monday!!!
Over the moon to announce that me and April are expecting our own tiny human! Due on Valentine's Day! http://t.co/6uvyOODhCb

What's it like to have a girlfriend? I got a Valentine's Day heart with a piece of candy in 7th grade. Basically the same thing.
Oh dear.. so many love confessions today! It may be my birthday, but it's not Valentine's Day. Hehe.. either way, thank you very much!

@DaveEllis11 @klavierstuk but if Zlatan is available for a reasonable fee, it may well be worth going for, for an immediate solution.
@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !
I would love to have cavani man. He's over shawdowed and played 2nd fiddle to Zlatan he would shine at arsenal

Again, awful from Barca. Not the best result, they should get 3 goals or more. Calderon on the 12th, serious.
Vermaelen the hero for Barca: Thomas Vermaelen was the unlikely hero as Barcelona laboured to a 1-0 home win over Malaga on Saturday ...
#Barca Did Florentino Perez make the schedule in La Liga? Barca's 1st 4 away games all against top 8 teams; RM plays Sevilla &amp; 3 creampuffs.
@jodynotjodie Same. Knackered. I'm going into town tomorrow to watch it. Probably go Barca on the locks. Where you watching it?!
Pedro sat bench for Barca &amp; KDB wins POTY in Germany but yet Pedro is the "better" player.
@BenUFO hey ben really enjoyed your set in barca last night, what was the 2nd last track you played? sounded like caribou?
had great time in Barca, also made some profit which is always nice. Back to the online grind for the sunday today #vamoooos #lfg
Return of Sunday morning watching the lad play footy. All week I picture them playing like Barca, the reality is very different. #YouthFooty
@ASR_Nick This is the Roma I wanna see vs Barca in Rome on the 16th. The match will be epic.
Done my balls in Barca but still treated myself to a five euro 1st class upgrade on the fast train to Madrid. #BudgetBaller
(Assuming Barca are the best team in the world) Who is the 2nd best in your opinion?
@Mattyy_Official It solves part of the problem but the jigsaw still has some big gaps that need addressing by 6pm tomorrow! Enjoy Barca!
For football fans, it's transfer deadline day. For us, barca fans, its just another Monday :v
@EPHowie Did you not see my reply? Barca's front 3 tomorrow. Don't EVEN @ me.
Plus, Atleti still killing it. My heart may belong to Barca but I love the competition. First place may not be so predictable. (2/2)
@halamufc @swagattt @joelsimondsouza Personally I think Utd should just tell Madrid, the deal is gone and then in January sell DDG to Barca
Barca may have the best players, but they are miles away from having the best team. Look at that shit def. #barca https://t.co/N3uFl2XIam
@ChampionsLeague @FCBarcelona barca will successfully defended the title, with the arda and aleix in January plus MSN I don't see them lose.
He was in the Atletico academy, Real is the biggest team in Europe next to Barca. All his friends are in Madrid. LOL https://t.co/AiCHWLTiU8
@AnderJuanderful when managers/players make it a matter of their ego then things always go bad. That's his problem.. 2nd stint at Barca e.g
@jamiepowell07 its the dogs, ye its amazing and defo go to a barca game, the 1st footie game ive enjoyed in years
Definitely Liverpool's anthem is the best, 2nd is Barca's one, love it!
@THE_RAJ14 he should come out in press now. And may be sign for Barca or City. :D
Then everton will get the player from Barca on loan :) https://t.co/n1vOyCdFiy
@bluekippercom @edmunddafox he's off to barca in January
@Guinnessvip Equally he's d 2nd most expensive under21s(after Neymar's Barca move)&amp;3rd most expensive signing in ManU's history #MadeOfBlack
Real Madrid get better of De Gea saga, Barca goalies also under pressure: While transfer deadline day may have... http://t.co/8iDvgc7zAN
.@http://pinurl.co/MakeMoneyWithGooglejr may make Barca return against Malaga: Coach http://t.co/u00NuZqQAt
@PeterNicolaides it is true 4th biggest behind Barca, RM and Manchester United with over 50m fans
@jack_blackwell @Jeinnylizarazo here's the thing if you put barca and Madrid in the epl it would be exactly the same in la liga barca 1st
@namorbassi loooool phones a myth. In Venice today, going to Nice in the morning then going Barca on saturday for a week. Also send money
Friends of Barca, I'm off on saturday to travel round Spain so would like to see as many of you as possible... http://t.co/BirDdHrBuf
But I really wanna go out this evening, or tomorrow, doesn't matter, I just wanna party! There's not better place to than Barca.
Good luck to all our teams for tomorrow 1st games of the season. Celtic,Rangers,Barca,Real,Olympic,Boca, Bayern &amp; Atletico #grassroots
Heavy saturday, Barca. The rain was knowing that how much I love you ! https://t.co/cRGyvsKidC
@Shehroze_MUFC we are 3rd same as Bayern after RM and Barca. why the fuck are you taking the name of that snake.
@javiruiz_9 Yeah!!!! May the force be with you, just believe in yourself, the team and don't forget you play for BARCA!!!!! @Monchurodriguez
@tfaheel haha no, the first was just Barca and then I put the "|" just to separate for my 2nd club
@hotcheetos4 still got smacked by Barca. Wolfsburg went far in the Europa and BVB lost to finalists. EPL is 3rd.
Fifa sunday! @LezzD PSG or Barca all the way @goitsemakwati
The Tenerife vs. Barca Femeni game has commenced. Jenni Hermoso scored for Barca in the 5th minute. Tenerife 0-1 Barca. #FCBLive
Barca beats Joventut 86-77 in 1st preseason game. Marc Garcia and Demond Mallet led all scorers with 20 points each
@haidar_altaie @FootyQuestions1 Exactly. Only reason Torres even came back into the lime-light were for 1st minute goals vs Madrid &amp; Barca
@BespokeBarware boo hoo... In Barca at the moment! The bar doesn't open Sunday and Monday's! Go home Tuesday. #tikisad
@Hayles_101 the chap is in his 2nd season of a 3 year deal. He has done the business at barca and Munich and I'm sure he will do it for us.
@christhomas1190 he'll be ready in January for Barca!!
@andrewmperry the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now.
Can't wait for Arda to play with Barca, January na pls! https://t.co/RWRRFgDnf0
@Oo_Gho_Gho So Neymar being fifth and Eden being 6th shows nothing other than Barca did better than chelsea in the CL.
@Kayboy_007 he should walk straight to barca's 1st team.
Slowly getting my last bits pulled together for Barca! Gonna get everything finalised today so I can just relax tomorrow :)
@FFC_JM @adidasUK may all the power of Barca and Messi be with you this season!
Neymar shockingly starts playing for Brazil like he does for Barca https://t.co/RSuKe3s16i
@EhabIbrahim77 Man Utd are a bigger club than everyone besides Real and Barca. They may be at the top of their game by the time he peaks
@MoeAnabtawi Barca is the best team not Real .. no one can win over it ... and see u on Sat ;)
Before bed, just gimme a bit of strength for tomorrow, Batman! https://t.co/f6vrZvZECU

Still working on Batman and the hero's journey and archetype. We will wrap that up tomorrow. Also finishing up RCBM assessments. Goal 151/0.
@GailSimone maybe replacing people/ concepts we don't like in real life with heroic figures?We may not agree with Batman but he gets results
@GailSimone Donald Trump may think he's essentially Batman but we'd prefer Batman to run for president because... Well, he's Batman.
@jmilam71591 @DCComics  I hate that they have about 3-4 active universes around. Also, having to take from batman's villain stable? C'mon.
I just scanned that Batman comic. I will post it tomorrow on my website, Tumblr, Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, Friendster, LiveJournal, etc.
You can tell that saving the 'Ice Princess' was one of those mundane, Monday jobs for Batman. #BatmanReturns

If Donald Trump becomes President? I will leave the country. I'll come back but may visit a few foreign places while Americans still can.
If the world doesn't end with the blood moon, and Donald Trump becomes president, I may need to do something drastic. Like go into a coma.
So what if Donald Trump is right on some things? Like the old saying goes "the sun will shine on a dog's ass, occasionally." ;-)

@CMchatLIVE CQ4: As much as I'd want to say the 1st Julie Roberts or Eric Church's live album, Appetite by GNR is my answer. #CMchat
Yo, if you paid $57-$77 to go see Eric Church at the State Fair...may the Lord have mercy on your souls.

Take me back to Friday night to the Eric church concert
Dierks Bentley and Eric Church at @countryconcert! Happy 22nd birthday to me! Is it July yet?
Murray has given it his all, which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but Federer just unbreakable. TB 2nd set. #CincyTennis
Federer stays winning. Into the finals tomorrow.
Federer beats Murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach #CincyTennis final. He'll be going for his 7th title vs Novak Djokovic, who is going for his first
Way to go Roger. Old man Federer just keeps rolling along. #Djokernole v. #Fed for the final tomorrow. #CincyTennis
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
@SkySportsNewsHQ the news should be Federer qualifies for 8th Cincinnati final. Not Murray knocked out.
Federer will play another final tomorrow. This guy is just amazing. #CincyTennis
Excited for the Federer vs. Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. Should be some great tennis!
Serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. Joins Djokovic and Federer in tomorrow's #CincyTennis singles finals. Decent trio.
Love this new trick that Federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. Running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
Federer will be 2nd seed at @usopen if he wins this. Djokovic aiming to become 1st player to win all 9 Masters 1000 tournaments #CincyTennis
Federer takes the opener 7-6(1) against Djokovic. Better player in the set &amp; winning plenty behind the 2nd serve. http://t.co/U2hbTK5qMC
Federer breaks early in the 2nd set! Even consolidates the break! Up 3-0! #RF #Tennis #CincyTennis
Federer's a man with a mission... 7th one coming.. #CincyTennis
Tiger, Federer, Serena, the Niners (eesh about those guys), and some cold TX brews. laaazzzy birthday Sunday.
For the 1st time, Federer has beaten No.1 and No.2 players in the ATP Rankings in consecutive matches en route to a title. #CincyTennis
Federer is my 2nd fave male tennis player of all time right after the great Arthur Ashe.
Has Federer shocked Murray and Djokovic with his turbo-charged aggression? Will they respond? New podcast tomorrow http://t.co/oy9eqomY3L
What a great day for world sport: Usain got his 9th gold, Federer claimed Cincinnati Title no 7 and I pumped some weights. #truepro
New @TennisPodcast tomorrow, reviewing Federer, Serena and the pre US Open storylines. This is what we sound like https://t.co/2x0O2UDCe8
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!
23rd of August was such a nice day, England lift Ashes, Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati.
"Papa you need a hat" thus said one of Federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning Cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer
Federer overtakes Lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the US Open in the Open Era. 15th straight year. Connors leads with 18.
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time.
You'll love this. @FedfanTejal #BlastFromThePast, Federer, Murray, Serena, Djokovic. Its got it all. #WorthTheRead  https://t.co/4hducxvFiP

@tsExtraTime @BenRothenberg Novak is surely the man to beat. Federer or Murray may run him to the base line. The usual suspects.
I believe #Rafa could win a 3rd #USOpen title if he can make it to the semifinals at least because of Federer, Murray, etc. #usopenworld
@oreillyfactor @realDonaldTrump @ThePeople4Trump @mikecahall1  the U.S. Open is rockin..Nadal tonite, Federer tomorrow
How to watch Federer and Murray on Tuesday at the 2015 US Open: Roger Federer will begin his 2015 US Open on T... http://t.co/GlxQkdiJZN
@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1. His draw is tricky. So is Murray's.If Fed reaches the QFs, then he may meet Berdy.
I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow!
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss.
@camerondallas Federer is about to begin his 2nd round. Go watch it.
Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.
Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!
Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!
Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round
@SJauhar I keep trying to book as soon as I learn when Federer's playing - too late. Nosebleed seats for 4th round (!) going at $250.
Most Masters 1000 titles (27) 2nd most Grand Slam titles (24 tied with Sampras after Federer's 17)
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen
Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!
Just like in the 2nd, Federer breaks back.
Roger while having trouble with serve, he is still through to 4th round! Federer might face Isner in 4th round
5 time @usopen champion Federer defeats 29th seed Kohlschreiber and he's through to the last 16 to play 13th seed Isner or Vesely! #USOpen
Federer is through to his 15th straight 4th round at the US Open. He's 8-4 with two other wins by walkover. http://t.co/p36dNjyxkV
Federer is gonna be playing in the championship on the first sunday of the nfl season. Tough decisions

Monday at the US Open: Murray, Federer &amp; Konta are all in action at Flushing Meadows today http://t.co/50ZM0cOEjT http://t.co/YlLS4kf0of
Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
Federer saved 4 BP (from 0/40) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set.
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el
Wow, Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves. Fed 0/8 on bps tonight
Federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. #USOpen
Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... Lol wow
In French Open QF, Federer didn't break serve -- 1st time in Slam match in 13 years. Tonight he breaks for 1st time in his last return game.
i out of 11 breakpts converted-not nearly good enough by Federer at #USOpen2015 . C'mon, Deliciano, you can beat Novak- Believe !
@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak
Federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the ATP Finals after reaching the US QF #FinalShowdown http://t.co/ugI3PQBp8w
With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g

I think I may have popped my ear drums and a vain in my head from singing along to Fleetwood Mac very loudly down the parkway #noregrets
Can't listen to Fleetwood Mac's "Not That Funny" without feeling like it's being sung by a petulant 6th grader.
Three bands who could have challenged @ledzeppelin : 1st Jeff Beck Group, Free and Fleetwood Mac (with Peter Green).
Need Your Love So Bad by Fleetwood Mac is #nowplaying in The Sun, Lancaster.  Download it now at http://t.co/E10dPZUkNG

Sports programme theme tunes were a topic on the radio just now. Fleetwood Mac - The Chain for BBC F1 a classic but Ski Sunday was also good
Free Music on the Bandstand at DLWP this Sat. The Equatorial Group. 'Sounding like Crazy Horse colliding with Fleetwood Mac on a dusty road'
I may say a lot of things about Fleetwood Mac, but the Rumours album is practically perfect.

Maybe now you guys understand why I changed my name from Save Hannibal Sam to Hannibal Killed Sam on Thursday night #HannibalMicDrop
Hannibal has been the most amazing show on NBC. I really hope they get a 4th season. Bryan Fuller is amazing #Hannibal #HannibalFinale
At the ending, there're oysters on Hannibal's table. How considerate Hannibal is ...but c'mon Will needs fishes #Hannibal #HannibalMicDrop
ugh also i forgot hannibal is ending...i never kept up with it but i still feel pretty sad it was a damn good show, 1st season
ugggggggh I want to watch Hannibal finale but I am too tired. Perhaps when I get up tomorrow I will
ok when I'm sober tomorrow I NEED to talk to people about Hannibal
I'm just sat here crying over the last episode of Hannibal #bye
@afooltocry @HorrorHoneys It's my uneducated opinion that Breaking Bad is the best show in the history of time.Hannibal might now be the 2nd
@neoprod @GillianA @NBCHannibal well you can't do this all by yourself ... Hannibal is inviting to Dinner and Will may finally accepting him
Hannibal finale on Wednesday in the UK. Time to catch up on all the episodes I missed while on holiday.
Tomorrow I will start catching up on Hannibal. I got to ep2 of S3 and had to stop because I wasn't ready for what a ride it was gonna be.
We're deep in Season 3 of HANNIBAL and Will Graham may have met his match with The Tooth Fairy http://t.co/aHbA8EnCJG http://t.co/fJP8d00hgs
@theofficialmads may I say sir your portrayal of Hannibal is beautiful and haunting. Hope you get this message. Look forward to ur next work
@WatIsEyebrow noooo not yet. We had a birthday date night last night. Plus I watch it on hulu, which means no Hannibal until Sunday :/
I would've preferred that episode 4 of Hannibal season 3 was the 2nd episode of it. would've been better to check on everyone earlier.
According to my DVR, the penultimate episode of HANNIBAL is just the 4th quarter of a NFL preseason game. I could eat a face.
I may have a massive love-hate relationship with Hannibal but Bryan Fuller's heart has always been in the right place.
I'm going to be so tired tomorrow but all I want to do is reblog Hannibal related stuff on tumblr. *cries* #Hannibal
Binge watched Hannibal all night and I may have just checked under my bed for a killer. #adultlife
I thought I had enough strength for the Hannibal finale. Tomorrow is lost.
@wylerette it may be called Hannibal but the show does revolve around the both of them plus bryan said they are meant to stay together
We've got to wait until Wednesday night here in the UK for the Hannibal finale yet I've pretty much seen it all in gif form
@eattherudecast I think it's Hannibal and Clarice on the run together, which I loathed, but Bryan's talk of an "inversion" may make it work
I met Em and Blaine through Hannibal. I may have my issues with the show but I'm modest enough to respect that.
I'm crying! :O  Thank you @NBCHannibal for giving Hannibal a home for 3 years, and doing your best to keep it there  https://t.co/QJCCTlhNFS
Hannibal's 3rd season feels like it became more and more a parody of itself.
Tweet from the great state of Denial. New tv show called #Hannibal on thur at 10pm. The guy plyn Hannibal has good cheek bones. Im intrigued
Tonights a good stopping point. Tomorrow I watch the last 6 episodes of Hannibal, ie. the Red Dragon arc.

@NatalehB Unfortunatly irl I don't know anyone who watches Hannibal with me so I'm really looking forward to Saturday :-)
@_grumpycoconut Monster is an anime. Hannibal is a live action NBC show. It just finished its 3rd season.
I loved the Hannibal finale Saturday. It was good enough and open enough to interpretation to please all types of Fannibal. #HannibalMicDrop
@amalalllama it's a lot bigger than you may think just take a look at Hannibal

Bit concerned my brother hasn't read the facebook message I sent him asking him to bring me the last 2 episodes of Hannibal tomorrow.

@arthurrcustodio - ahhh don't talk about it!! I'll start tomorrow night at home or the day after. Need to finish Hannibal first
There's a 99% chance I'm going to start Hannibal tomorrow.
My mum just asked me what we're supposed to watch now on Thursday nights since Hannibal is over ;A;
help help it is thursday and my brain is saying hey remember back when an episode of Hannibal would be airing in 2 hours in Canada
@lilmacmillan I'll be Abigail on Saturday and Hannibal on Sunday :D If you think you see me shout loud and I'll probably hear it~
Also @unwoman gets into town tmrw! Sunday + Monday I'm going up to Hannibal to see her (and various other friends) at the steampunk expo.
I'm so glad we're doing this. I'm so glad we're doing it on Saturday too. ha.  Hannibal isn't leaving my life nope! #Hannibal #EatingThem
I have packed just about everything needed for #Tracon starting tomorrow. I am now allowed to watch a couple episodes of Hannibal and knit.

I'm so excited for the new episode of Hannibal tomorrow *cries*
@SharingTheGuilt -may try and poison me? Hmm?" Hannibal stood straight, he said that in an almost sarcastic tone but this was still a cat -
@someotherworld @brasspetal @DarklingGrotto we need to reach the speed of light, we may need Hannibal's help

Hannibal gets another TD w/ 10:03 left in the 3rd quarter, extra point no good. Boonville is down 30-7.   .@KOMUsports  #FNF
Nearing the end of Season the 1st of HANNIBAL. I love it so much already I'm devastated in advance that the show stopped before Clarice.
@emmacaulfield 2nd only to Hannibal in best show of the year. Who was knocking at the door??? #MrRobot
Hi @FANEXPOCANADA - I noticed in the Guide app that there's no mention of the Hannibal photo op on Sunday. Is it still running? Great job!
@eddus We've gone for Hannibal over trash but still, lazy days! Am excited to see you and catch up tomorrow. Hello to R.
@BryanFuller Just rewatching the 2nd series finale of Hannibal for the nth time. Not enough words to explain how much it all means to me!
@alfredosaucyy it was on thurs :/ it was a last minute secret show at club bahia. it was so dope! Hannibal and donnell rawlings came thru
FINALLY washed off all the blood. I had so much fun running around as Abigail today. Decided I'm doing Nigel and Hannibal tomorrow.
@BrianPerNiceDay @lecafedufacade So used to watching Hannibal on Saturday I am shocked I am going clubbing. #Hannibal #FannibalsArentDone

I start college tomorrow. I think today is the best day to start watching Hannibal
#Hannibal has been a brilliant series tho &amp; the fact we don't know if Hannibal is still alive leaves door open for a 4th season #Hopefully
@FrygtCanophilis Hannibal was still in the room sat on the chair reading
@Vortex566 oo I need to get back in to Hannibal! Did season 1 then just kind of stopped. Yar, started last week. You got kids in tomorrow?
I'm getting up at 6 tomorrow so I sticked in and out Hannibal after I realized next episode has the girl waiting under beds to murder people
Okay I'm going to watch Dexter and Hannibal and get high and sleep because fuck Monday.
Holy shit I just now opened the Hannibal's Kitchen envelope someone handed me Friday night #dragoncon #Hannibal http://t.co/v8DX9Jl0Pv
@Illessa Based on the 1st ep, Mr Robot seems a good series to go on to.It looks to respect the audience in the same way as Hannibal, a least
@Amirabiabdallah Dexter is great but give Hannibal another try, it gets better after the 5th episode :p
@filmgrabber Michael Marshall shot the hell out of the Hannibal finale. (This movie rules. Loving Maddin Monday)
While I was at Taco Bell I got to thinking about Hannibal. I might not be ready to watch the finale but MAYBE I could watch the 2nd to last.
OK so maybe I'm watching, for the 1st time, the 1st episode of the 1st season of Hannibal and OH MY LORD WHAT IS THIS
@FrygtCanophilis Hannibal removes his hand from your forehead, Will's temperature was back again. He sat down beside the younger man -
@LowriBearman Thank you my love! And I have had a fab day! Distinct lack of Hannibal but I'll put that right tomorrow! xx
@TheEricGoldman Seriously, when people lament they didn't take the 1st possible deal for Hannibal, I tell them go watch Lost in La Mancha.
@FromPillow but idk when i'm gonna get around to hannibal and i know wonderfalls is just a season, so i may just tide myself over with that
I'll be sending off Summer and HANNIBAL tomorrow. It'll be a bittersweet day.
@SkyLivingHD I'm going to be lost without Hannibal on a Wednesday
Unpopular opinion:  Harper is right to think Nats fans ditching in the 7th inning was brutal.  No sure he was right to say it though.

@Misesforever @Liz_Cheney If u keep Harper as PM I may well cross the Lake myself! U have one incredible leader. Balanced budget and all!
If Harper doesn't want fans to leave in the 7th perhaps he and his teammates should stop under performing and losing big ball games? #nats
yeah, Harper went 0-3 tonight. that doesn't mean he doesn't have every right to call out every single fake nats fan that left in the 7th
Choosing to read the transcript of the interview Mansbridge did with Harper due to the extreme 2nd hand embarrassment I'm bound to endure

@AdamRubinESPN I'm happy to see the #Nats sat Zimmerman over Harper...Harvey owns Harper #Mets
@Shauncore he could, but Harper has been a freak all year, and Votto's 1st half wasn't amazing.

Big spot for Harper now in the 7th to impress the fans left in the park
Shame all the fans that stuck around to see a six run lead blown and Harper make an out for the 8th time in two games. #Nationals
Harper may never get a hit against the Mets the rest of his career #LGM
@maryb889 Still have the 9th &amp; top of order!  Harper walkoff homer!
Werth, Rendon, and Harper due up in the bottom of the 9th, #Nats trail Mets 8-7.
I hope all the fans stayed into the 9th to watch Harper go 0-5. #nats
He's bunting!? That leaves 1st open to walk Harper and set up the DP

@RedPorchReport Harper putting up historic numbers. Thus far it's been a series to forget at the plate, but, again, he didn't pitch the 7th.
@SBNationMLB @SBNation The idea that the Mets would have walked Harper if it was 1st/2nd no outs in lunacy.

I now have to read the 4th Harry Potter for english and my one homework assignment is watch the Two Towers
If I put in the first Harry Potter movie right now I'll finish the whole series by tomorrow.
The pacing for the 4th Harry Potter movie was so ridiculously off and it ruined the entire movie.
Finally sat down and got going on my homework and Mary asks if we wanna watch Harry Potter. It's like she wants me to flunk out of school.
J.K. Rowling wrote the final chapter of the 7th Harry Potter book 9 years before the 1st book was even released.
Okay guys going to take the night off to finally get rid if this cold. I'll be online tomorrow labor day for Harry Potter trivia
Perfect date week would be watching all the Harry Potter movies. Obviously the last night would be pt 1&amp;2 of 7th movie.

@BRADSPORTS @jaketapper The news is bad for her. Ergo, it may not be presented as the most happy thing for Hillary.
In this, the 4th roll out of the Hillary campaign, SPONTANEITY is the operative word !!
Hillary is the Washington establishment, say whatever it takes to get elected. We need a change up... It may not be me but elect someone
Hillary: That was a mistake. I'm sorry about that." @EricBoehlert @mmfa going to need a complete script rewrite. http://t.co/PZ9puhBOqy

U know Hillary is panicking when Chelsea Clinton will be speaking at the Amy Schumer show in Boston this Friday.
This may or may not be true but it doesn't change the fact that Hillary violated the law
@tbridis this why people don't believe anything Hillary say this person will soon take the 5th
@pbt3 @timthejarhead @SpringSteps That way he will testify, otherwise he's said he will plead the 5th. This is finally a way to sink Hillary
@ABCPolitics @ABC @DavidMuir OMGosh! HIllary still using her deceased Mom as a PROP to save herself from her own lies. ~May she RIP.
@ianbremmer @Eagle_Vision I'm sure Hillary kept a copy of all the original emails somewhere. Where is the 5th thumb-drive Hillary?
LOLing at Hillary apology...1st she said all of us were "confused" (a nice way of saying "stupid); now she apologizes 4 using server. #greta
Hillary apologizes the way Kardashians wed--several times in quick succession &amp; never sincerely.
To look less guilty Hillary requests staffers to not plead the 5th,but use 2nd &amp; 3rd together. By: @weknowwhatsbest  https://t.co/8Spn6b7CP1

@SameBackwards it may sound great. Plus Hillary will work awesome with congress and promote equality worldwide.
Hillary: So all I have to do is have an unsecured server with national secrets on it, and I'll win? Cooooool!!! https://t.co/E3rS53QMbz
Hillary will not make history as 1st female Pres. She'll make history by being 1st Pres candidate to be indicted on criminal charges.
@davidrook Or Hillary or Sanders.  We may have to rethink this whole democracy thing if someone does not step up after the pre-season. :D
@BlissTabitha So I guess dropping in on the Kardashians was just her 1st gig? The "New/Fresh" Hillary primed for reality TV Generation!
You may not have seen, but the left loves their liars, cheats &amp; traitors. Hillary is their perfect candidate! https://t.co/rP2z1upkwM
The republicans ask a sketchy candidate to pledge to the party and its ideas, Hillary demands loyalty from anyone who may like her.

Hillary cares only about Hillary. I choose to wait for a credible female to become our 1st woman president. Smart women aren't desperate!
@foxandfriends  Hillary is sorry now that she may be facing criminal charges for what they found in her email
Remember Hillary denied a server existed  ever day ! A liar for President  like Obama this Country will not survive  https://t.co/qfrjOXgSBz
@RealJamesWoods I hear that Hillary's Authenticity Czar is going on the Sunday shows.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika Hillary said that on Sunday, to Andrea Mitchell what are you on a time delay?
Did anyone see Hillary's Server Boy actually plead the 5th or did his Lawyers only do this in the media? @TGowdySC @greta @zerohedge
I believe we may have a major security scandal with prominent people involved in the unclassified Hillary server. Is there a cover up ?
Hillary can take her phony apology and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. She is only sorry she was caught it's all about power.
@RonJohnsonWI is trying to cut the legs off @TGowdySC investigation.   Hillary's Server Boy DID NOT take the 5th under oath!

Apple has a recall on all 1st generation iPod Nano's, And will give you a 6th generation iPod Nano if you return the 1st generation one.
I should be getting into bed, I am however instead looking through my iPod for songs I might want to pole to.  I may be addicted.
No iPod until 10th grade began... Brother is still in elementary and succeeded in convincing dad he 'needs' one.
I have to deal with this ipod so rest in pieces my emo snowflake fuckers. Here's to our tomorrow. Thank you for living to see today.

When I do auto time on my iPod it thinks it January 24 1971
I drenched the old iPod nano (6th gen) in isopropanol and it actually worked! The screen will never look the same but totally worth it.

@MARC_RYDER   Yeah bro but it's warning shot. You can't go all in on the 1st track. Jay-z made that mistake and Nas FINISHED him.

Going through a Jay-Z album per day starting tomorrow. Skipping over Best of Both Worlds though. Hated that one.
For those who may not know, Jay-Z wrote the verses for Still D.R.E but he's never disrespected Dre or ever spoken about ghostwriting.
December 4th only cause I used the beginning in my Jay-Z speech for class https://t.co/5bw2R2xGvo

Meek Mill or 12 year old white boy that just discovered Jay-Z? The world may never know
Meek drooped like a Jay-z album the 2nd &amp; 3rd time you hear it. You will understand it and Fall in love with it
Jay-Z stole his whole 2nd verse from "99 Problems" from Bun B in the UGK song "Touched". Come on y'all listen to old hip hop.
I was in like the 4th, 5th, 6th grade burning CDs and mixtapes that faithfully consisted of Dipset, old Bone Thugs, and hella Jay-Z
Jay-z may not be the best looking guy, but he proves to others that looks aren't everything
Roadblock: In the immortal words of Jay-Z: "Whatever deity may guide my life, dear lord don't let me die tonight.... http://t.co/mnDysX2NKb
"Jay-Z stole all his music in Reasonable Doubt."  That may be true, but he stole some timeless, genius shit

the 1st dance at my wedding will actually just be a duet of Diamonds From Sierra Leone-Remix with my husband as Jay-Z and myself as Kanye.
Aye now Meek may surprise us. You know when Jay-Z dropped Takeover they thought it was over for Nas. And then Ether......
May the best of your today be the worse off your tomorrow - Jay-Z
#WEHO: @ChrisPipkinSC is leading the pack for a THE CARTERS: Lil Wayne, Beyonce, and Jay-Z ride Thursday at 5:30pm! Grab a bike!
If you pine for a time when Jay-Z didn't suck, then listen to Czarface. Esoteric, 1/3rd of the group, is a dead ringer for his voice.
August 5th is Work Like a Dog Day. Because sometimes you just have to do what you have to do. Jay-Z said it well: can't knock the hustle!...
3rd verse on 745 by Gucci the best diss verse period. He dissed Jay-Z &amp; Jeezy &amp; crushed that shit.

Personally handing Jay-Z jerseys may be the highlight of my New York existence. First time I've been star struck.
Jay-Z and Beyonce came to Taylor's 25th but not Kim and Kanye's wedding. Imma let Taylor finish, but she had the best birthday of all time.

Who Belong In the 3rd spot for top 3 of all time. Jay-Z, Nas or Eminem?
Make a lasting impression on the first day of class tomorrow: walk in with a boom box blaring Public Service Announcement by Jay-Z
Jay-Z make time for Bey.. The President make time for the 1st lady. So where are you so busy at again?
Song Cry x Jay-Z is one of my favorite songs, don't screw over the one that's been dsd1 no matter what changes life may bring, just don't.
When you realize classes start the 9th so the AC/DC concert will be the best concert since Eminem and Jay-Z #thatwasgoat
@insanityreport @rodimusprime there's no middle ground with her though. Her Jay-z insights used to veer off into the 3rd testicle range
Jay-Z: Can I get a Fuck You? Jay-Z's Dad: I don't know, CAN you? Jay-Z: MAY I get a Fuck You? Jay-Z's Dad: No, it's supper time. Go wash up.

When Jay-Z said, "Thirty-eight revolve like the sun round the Earth" http://t.co/WxW2bOLCEl

@JKailli Although you may know this better than I do since you're from California lol I'm not knocking Jay-Z view in black culture, I say
"We make a million of beats, cause our stories is deep. And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet." - Jay-Z
Only looking forward to Kanye's performance at the VMA's tomorrow! Heard he's bringing out Rih, Bey, Jay-z &amp; Paul McCarthy
I was certainly not expecting @JColeNC to bring @Drake and Jay-Z to the Ville.  I may have dropped a tear or two.  Greatest show ever!
"See baby photos of Blue Ivy Carter, the daughter of Beyonce and Jay-Z," - Huffington Post https://t.co/i8uyzsulTu
Jay-Z may have his big companies... And Beyonce but that doesn't amount  to what Nas has done for the world and the people.
Also the correct Top 5 is Eminem, Jay-Z, 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., and Ice Cube in that order with Big Pun as the 6th man
Jay-Z sat in that Interview like a God showing that he was truly ahead of his time while the other niggas flirting with Foxy Brown

@manneredguy @BallHogba @j85royals Like Juventus is big. But really thought one of the big 3 may have made a play with a loan
Very interesting UCL group stage draw. #AFC should qualify 2nd at the very least. Lovely draw for Man Utd and Juventus!! :D
@CoolFMNigeria @manipulator77 @MercyAjisafe @AjukaRosemary Man city, the group is tricky, Juventus to top, Sevilla n city will fight for 2nd
Group D looks pretty intense with Borussia Mon, Juventus, Man City &amp; Sevilla!
Man City up against Juventus and Sevilla in the #ChampionsLeague - do you think they have a chance? @MCFC http://t.co/PeHQbX17k5
Well Rome is rather beautiful! Can't wait to the Roma - Juventus game on Sunday! http://t.co/9OsshdZwX0
87 years of Italian Serie A history produced a first for Juventus on Sunday: they lost at home on the opening day of the season
Juventus will lose to Roma on Sunday and will lift the Scudetto come end of the season.
https://t.co/86ThfnhgBK Rudi Garcia insists Roma must come flying out of the blocks when they take on Juventus tomorrow. #RomaJuve @asroma
@HoldTheMilan Chelsea and Liverpool lost now I hope Milan wins and Juventus lose tomorrow and it will be the perfect weekend
Big day of sport tomorrow. United - Swansea, Roma - Juventus, Inter - Carpi, and the big one, Mayo - Dublin.
Juventus! "@SerieAlive: Roma v Juventus kickoff #SerieA Sunday. Who do you love?"
Wolfsburg are on fire today! Today they may be announcing the signing of Draxler, Praet who was also linked with Juventus and Dante!
@mast84 how much more? (to be clear I hate Juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. They may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly
Only going by the latest game stats but think I may have made a mistake backing juventus
This is very bad for Juventus. Lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss Pirlo, Tevez &amp; Vidal already :(
Juventus hopeless without their 3 key players and a poor transfer window. Hope the cunts end up 5th in the league.
Our performance was unreal today man, beating Juventus 2-1 on the 2nd game of the season is a massive motivational boost for the team.
Juventus had two men sent off as their dismal start to defending their Serie A title continued with defeat at Roma on Sunday.
I will undergo my medical for Juventus tomorrow, I can play trequartista and CAM, both at the same time.
De Rossi believes Juventus may struggle to cope this season as he does not think they have adequately replaced Tevez, Pirlo or Vidal
If Draxler news is true, Juventus has been humiliated this transfer window. May be leaving without the trequartista they need and 0-2.
@ACMilanSydney Milan, in my opinion, have only the 7th best squad, after Inter, Roma, Juventus, Lazio, Napoli and Fiorentina.
@cafecrema69 Inter may have a chance this season with Juventus sucking the big one so far!

@RichardGrenell @JohnKerry @UANI is the 2nd secret "side deal" for Iranian Palaces for O &amp; Kerry?

"People will accept ur ideas much more readily if u tell them Benjamin Franklin said it 1st." [DComins] || Which is y Kerry just quoted him.

Javier Saviola: "I'd be delighted if Messi won his 5th Ballon d'Or because of the quality of his football and because of our friendship."
Messi has ALWAYS scored in the 1st or 2nd leg of the CL Round of 16 since the 2007/08 season: 2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 6 - 2 - 1 (ongoing)
What a great cover for the 1986 winner....I feel @francefootball need to do something very special for Messi's 5th. http://t.co/ixSDV38UhN
Messi and Ronaldo both go up a rating in FUT 16 with Messi a 94 and Ronaldo 93 Suarez is a 90 as 3rd best player in the game.
Hahah Lol so Halilovic was shaking when he saw Messi for the 1st time. I'ld probably faint if i ever meet him.

Messi and Barcelona are preparing for the away game against Granada in La Liga tomorrow, kick-off 20:00 CET

@SivanJohn LOL the finishing was quite similar to Messi's 2nd goal against Bayern.
@LeslieeAndradee Messi scored with his 4th touch like omg! Like it's not fair.
Messi has now failed to score against Atletico for the 5th consecutive game
Messi takes the number 1 spot 94 rated while Ronaldo comes 2nd rated 93 in FIFA 16 interesting #fifa16 #rivalry

The 3rd goal scorer of Mauritania just became Messi right there passing five defenders....aowa Bafana Bafana
@Safeeyar yap. That's why i dont understand why they're making fun with messi's height. Do they expecting him to be a Jan Koller? Lol
Iniesta is the 3rd best after Messi and Ronaldo, no one comes close, not Neymar not Hazard #spain
Imagine having a 20th of Messi's ability. You'd be the best in your team
Sunday Supplement. Is Bale in the same class as Messi and Ronaldo?! "He's knocking on the door" don't make me laugh. Over hyped as always
Messi was just 20 years &amp; 161 days old when he secured a podium finish (3rd place) at the 2007 Ballon d'Or ceremony http://t.co/wwtDG2aWjb

Messi (back in January): 'My dream is to finish my career at Barcelona for as long as people want me'
De Biasi (coach ALB): "Ronaldo better keeps quiet tomorrow or Messi will get my vote for the Ballon d'Or this time."
Initial pass to Messi zipped in. Only he could tame the ball &amp; pass to Xavi 1st time. Minimal backlift from another planet. @Phase_in_out
I'm sad I can't watch Messi and the Argentina squad on Tuesday :(

MAGICAL MARCH - With 48 goals in 42 official matches the month March is now Messi's BEST MONTH in his Barcelona career
im just excited to see messi tomorrow
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
He can't dribble cos in Spain (like many EU countries), dribbling is seen as disrespectful, he has to play 2nd to Messi...
@FFC_JM @adidasUK may all the power of Barca and Messi be with you this season!
@CoutinhoRed @TaintlessRed Messi is on another level to CR and James is not the 4th best player in the world...

@Badandy538_ At the end of the day,  we're talking about great players so any argument against may sound like nitpicking. Messi is GOAT tho.
The Nats may have sucked again but now Messi is on TV and Colbert is back in an hour so it could be so much worse.
Messi may be the best player in the world but Chicharito is the best player in the universe #ChichaDios @CH14_ http://t.co/BbPKl2CfGj

If Messi gets injured tonight, Dallas won't exist tomorrow. https://t.co/9JlZf9f5Lh
Okay, I can see how you may not like lebron or Tom Brady but not Messi..this guy has nations on his back.
12:26am and we've got US Open Drama, Colbert's debut, and Messi just scored a sick goal for Argentina.  All Live/1st run now.
And that is why messi is the best in the world. Good game though. Now to wait till October 10.
And Argentina say Messi does nothing for the national team??! That goal was just magical Messi time as usual, c'mon! XD
Somebody get a mustache, a fake birth certificate and get Messi signed up for the US on October 10th, please.
Ok guys for the 3rd time MESSI WAS OUT OF PLACE THAT WASNT SUPPOSE TO BE A GOAL
@randomhero23 because they did not reply the play as much. 2nd time Messi scores a goal on Mexico like that
Very proud of that 2nd goal from Mexico! Even tho they didn't win (nothing new) props to Messi for the last min goal http://t.co/MMbK3Z706L
APOEL can become the 24th different opponent in UCL against which Messi has scored at least 1 goal. He has faced 31 teams in total
Proud!! Masche &amp; Messi scored, Neymar &amp; Rafi scored (Tue.), Alba and Iniesta (Sat.) &amp; were the only goalscorers in these games. #interlands
Messi has registered back-to-back hat-tricks (3+ goals) for Barcelona for the 3rd time in his career

LVE | Messi playing his 16th game against Getafe. So far, he has been directly involved in 21 goals (13 scored, 8 assisted)
@Fraudiesta I agree with Messi being 3rd but my top 3 would be:  1.Hazard 2.Suarez 3.Messi
But Messi made the former premier league champions look like a group of 11 lads at goals  https://t.co/fAPDWwbX0d
International Break Recap: Neymar, Messi, Rafinha score on Tuesday: Tuesday night was a good one for the Barcelona internationals tha...
Messi and Barcelona will resume La Liga action with a traditionally tricky trip to Real Sociedad (Sunday, kick-off 21:00 CET)
Top 3 players in the world? Has to be: Suarez/Ronaldo/Messi.  Only reason Messi is 3rd is because he's not proven in EPL. La liga is poor
You may dislike either Messi or Ronaldo, but you can't dislike Zlatan.

The best CGI in Ant-Man isn't the ant scenes. It's that 1st scene with Michael Douglas' face. #smhowzow
There are people who only watched Ant-Man for the Upstate NY cameo and the 2nd credit scene. Civil War is going to be pretty big.

@917thebounce may I remind you She's Kida Hot is number one on the iTunes chart while Bad Blood is at number 50 PLAY THE MORE POPULAR ONE
"@CSNGiants no more Bad Blood by Taylor Swift music please, the video on Monday was more like badluck!!! #badeditor #SFGiants #cheesymusic"
@castlescrumbln A response to Bad Blood may make the album ugly.
Bad Blood is not a music video it looks like a Pepsi super bowl commercial. It's 5 minutes of cameos to a song with 6th grade lyrics
Bad Blood is such a terrible fucking song. I just listened to it for the 1st time and I feel like God took a shit in my ears
Bad Blood may have the absolute worst lyricism I've ever heard in my life (regarding Taylors parts) #UsedtobeMadLove #ReallyDeepCut
Discussing the T Swift vs K Perry feud with boyf (he was unaware). He's a big fan of both. He says he's torn. May have to boycott Bad Blood.
I like Taylor Swift as much as the next man but Bad Blood may be the single worst song ever created in the history of mankind.
If it were Blank Space up for 7 awards tomorrow Taylor would sweep but since it's Bad Blood she'll probably only win 5/10
"It's kinda awful when you can relate to that ""Bad Blood"" song. Bc it's my life Monday thru Thursday. I did NOTHING! And if I did tell me!"
"Just gonna say it: The lyrics in ""Bad Blood"" sound like they were written by a 7th grader. ""Done"" doesn't have two syllables, Taylor."
Listening to Bad Blood on the radio 1st time: this is awful 8: people like this? 15: that bass line isn't so bad  Now: NOW WE GOT BAD BLOOD
"Miley doesn't like the ""Bad Blood"" video, says things about drugs etc http://t.co/1phoN7gN5T http://t.co/vN1xBZsKW9"
My parents' car rendition of Bad Blood may actually kill me one day
"Nieces were play Taylor Swift...I submit that ""Bad Blood"" may be the worst lyrical train wreck in music history. Just abysmal shit. #Duh-un?"
"Taylor Swift's song ""Bad Blood"" may be the most annoying song that's currently playing on the radio #TooRepetitive"
That Taylor Swift 'Bad Blood' may be the worst quality/budget music video I've ever watched
"#TheSecret says visualizations come true, so tomorrow night @taylorswift13 is bringing me on stage for Bad Blood, you guys."
"1st day training Taylor Swift for her MV ""Bad Blood"". She was a sweetheart and picked up quick! http://t.co/oTSKXhY4pp"

"@Warden_AoS if Dana White had his head any further up her box he'd disappear. Joe Rogan, too. Fucking paper champion who had 1st real fight."
"@boxingrich regardless of what he may say, a former boxer smashing UFC's biggest star last night was Dana White's worst nightmare"
"And the UFC is fucked up, Why you may ask? Because they are all getting hoed and controled by Dana White"
Biggest problem with UFC is that Dana White seems to feed sheep to lions for ticket sales. It's not exactly fixed but it may as well be.
Dana White &amp; Joe Silva are scum bag atheists and Ronda Rousey is endorsing Bernie Sanders. Don't give them your money. Stream the UFC on Sat
Dana White coming off as an asshole telling Holm's camp about immediate rematch in July &amp; she can't fight Tate. Selfish. What else is new.
Dana White gonna wake up tomorrow morning thinking he got super drunk because his bank account is half a billion dollars lighter #UFC193
"Dana White is a terrible promoter sometimes. Instead of praising Holm her for her performance, he says Rousey had a bad night? C'mon man."
"Dana White is gonna use Sean Shelby and Joe Silva as the scapegoats tomorrow, if not tonight."
Dana White may as well come out as being a faggot with how much he sucks Ronda Rousey's dick

"I fucking hate Dana White, let's not give Aldo a 2nd chance in a 13 sec fight but let's give Rhonda a rematch when she gets destroyed."
"If Dana White was smart, he would've waited on this fight. Stretched it out May v Pac style. McGregor is a promotional magnet. #UFC"
If I'm Holly Holm I think I go to Dana White &amp; hold him hostage. But I may just enjoy chaos a little too much

"If he gets the crap beat out of him Saturday, Dana White may die.  https://t.co/qUL45Gd5Lx"

Dana White says rematch #RouseyVsHolm is on for UFC200.  It will be at the new Las Vegas arena.  I think this could be bigger than May-Pac.
Danny White to be announced as UCF AD on Thursday. Not to be confused with Dana White. Another ND alum like Orsini.
Frankie Edgar shows Chad Mendes and Dana White that he deserves a title shot:  https://t.co/PE0LYAuL1d
"I called it ""Ronda Vs Holly 2"" Dana white and Ronda have said Yes there will be indeed Be a 2nd fight! so there you go MMA Fans! Yay!!!"
I've got Aldo winning by TKO in the 3rd round but if it goes to the judges McGregor wins cause you know he's Dana White's golden boy #UFC194
KO's theFW en route to 5th straight win. Then calls out Dana White in the post fight.  https://t.co/ndPUo2PoIy https://t.co/veCdjDpffU

@Chris__Shield @kizrees at least Dustin Johnson knows how to party which is why I'm guessing he falls apart by Sunday after his weekend out
"@KellyTilghmanGC  After the 2nd round, you did your usual melodramatic spew that Dustin Johnson was in a class of his own. Same old garbage."
After 75 today maybe I was wrong about Dustin Johnson getting over US Open collapse. Terrible 3rd RD #OpenChampionship
"Also, I see Dustin Johnson is leading after the 1st round of a major again. So he's gonna choke on the weekend again? #boring"
Apparently it's not just the final round that makes Dustin Johnson choke it's just Sunday.
Are we taking bets on when Dustin Johnson has a meltdown at the PGA? Saturday? Sunday? #DustinJohnson #PGAChampionship #choke
Can you bet on Dustin Johnson to be top five all week until Sunday when he comes 6th and below? I'd take that...
Did anyone tell Dustin Johnson that winning requires a lead on the 4th day and not just the 1st day?
Dustin Johnson and Sunday's just don't mesh well #PGAChampionship
Dustin Johnson dealt with another major disappointment after shooting +3 &amp; going from leading after 2 at -10 to being tied for 22nd &amp; at -7
"Dustin Johnson flies out of the blocks at every major, but he simply cannot get it right on a Sunday."
"Dustin Johnson having a complete meltdown on the 1st hole, on the green in 6 or 7 I've lost count. #PGAChampionship"
Dustin Johnson is completely melting down. Sunday's just don't agree with him. #PGAChamp
Dustin Johnson is just a pig with this 3rd and 4th round play
Dustin Johnson is just a walking disaster on Sunday's lately.
"Dustin Johnson isn't the first guy to drop 22 places in a major on Sunday, but it usually takes more than 1 hole. #PGAChampionship"
Dustin Johnson just can't do Sunday's
Dustin Johnson just took an 8 on the 1st hole. I don't feel so bad about my golf game suddenly. #PGAChampionship #snowman
Dustin Johnson leading the #PGAChampionship ...until the 3rd round of course when he naturally falls apart.
Dustin Johnson off to a flyer yet again! All he needs to do is stay off the coke on Saturday night.
"Dustin Johnson shot the 2nd worst round of anybody in the field on a day where literally almost every player was under par, just awful"
Just pulled a Dustin Johnson on the 18th at Castle Creek and don't know if I've ever been this depressed
"Just your typical Sunday ...Spieth and Day there in the end, while Dustin Johnson falls apart in his final round"
Looking at today's play at the #OpenChampionship You can't define Dustin Johnson's round as anything other than a choke. Tied for 2nd worst
Looks like Dustin Johnson won't be winning the pga championship after shooting an 8 on the 1st hole. #choke#PGAChampionship
Oh look dustin Johnson has blew up again lol. 7/4 after the 2nd round in places can now be backed at 50/1. #TheOpen #DustinJohnson #choker
"Once again Dustin Johnson is leading early in the tourny, which means he has plenty of time to screw it up on ether Saturday or Sunday"
"R&amp;A's handling of the end of round 2 was diabolical. I watched Spieth, Matsuyama and Dustin Johnson early Saturday, very unfair on them."
Well Dustin Johnson seems to have the anvil back in his bag on a Major Sunday. Dropped 20 spots on first hole. #SnowMan
"Well, Dustin Johnson isn't really in contention but that won't stop him from royally screwing things up on the Sunday of a major."
Whether it's the 3rd round or 4th round Dustin Johnson just doesn't like Sunday's in majors!!
#USPGA Man totally oblivious to Dustin Johnson's tee shot landing beside him at the 17th. #foreleft
8 for Dustin Johnson at the 1st. Playing my kind of golf.

"Dustin Johnson sure knows how to get an early lead on Thursday, he just can't hang on to that lead on Sunday"

"Dustin Johnson was in the final group Sunday, shot 75, and today he and Jim Furyk are paired 12 games before the final group @TheOpen."
Dustin Johnson will be awesome until he needs a 2ft putt on the 72nd hole come Sunday. Folds like a lawn chair under pressure. #PGA

I swear Dustin Johnson is winning at the end of the 1st-3rd rounds of every golf major
"If Dustin Johnson makes par at the 1st instead of quad, we have a ball game. He's still fun to watch"
If the PGA tour just played Thursday Friday Saturday. Dustin Johnson would win every tournament
"If you could win a golf tournament on the 1st day, then Dustin Johnson would have 9 majors by now."
Is Dustin Johnson the best 1st round player of all time? @ksalvo21
Is the 12th playing down wind?  Because Dustin Johnson just hit a pitching wedge 150 yards.

"Of all the things I'm envious of when it comes to professional golfers, Dustin Johnson's strut walk may be at the top of the list."
Quality start for Dustin Johnson with an 8. He apparently is not a fan of Sunday golf. #PGAChampionship
Really hope Dustin Johnson pulls it out the bag tomorrow and ties up #TheOpen  #Adidas #AdidasGolf
Some round from Dustin Johnson considering he started with an 8 on the 1st. Another case of what might've been for him at Whistling Straits.
THIS OFFER ENDS TOMORROW!   Get Dustin Johnson to finish in the TOP 5 at 3/1 or Jordan Spieth at 5/1 when you join: http://t.co/q7W6jsOxvo
Thank you very much Dustin Johnson. 1st round leader never in doubt!
"The 10th hole seems to be a good birdie hole. Dustin Johnson birdies the 10th, his 1st hole to move to -1 #PGAChamp"
"The winner of the #PGAChampionship  will come from Thursday's 9:05 tee time (Jason Day, Dustin Johnson &amp; Rickie Fowler)   #Prediction #Golf"
Things you can always count on on Thursday of a major:  Dustin Johnson leading; Tiger Woods over par.
This Dustin Johnson start is going to be even better when he blows it on Saturday or Sunday.
Tomorrow I'm doing the coolest thing of my life. I'm going to be in a Taylormade commercial as Dustin Johnson's playing partner!!!
Watching Dustin Johnson on Saturday and Sunday is amazing. The guy just can't do it. Ever
Wayward driver puts Johnson off the PGA pace  The horn may have been a welcome sound for Dustin Johnson.  http://t.co/HB9GmCNTSr
Well I pulled a Dustin Johnson on the 18th but I'm proud to say I played the best 9 holes of my life tonight #GoLow http://t.co/zBZR1EfiZC
Will this be the major that Dustin Johnson finally grabs? http://t.co/h2zhhSrq6q via @golf_com
"Would love to see Dustin Johnson make a huge charge tomorrow, he's got the game"
Wow Dustin Johnson showing some true grit after quadding number one #PGAChamp especially since his history with major Sunday's
see that dustin johnson is a co-leader right now. will take him serious if he is in top 3 on the final 9 sunday #pgachampionship

I am hearing a settlement may be in the works with Kane and alleged victim. He might be pulling a Kobe - WHICH MEANS HE IS GUILTY!!
I've been thinking about it... Does anyone else find it disturbing how Kane may face rape charges and GM's are calling on his availability?
Kane may have raped a woman &amp; the 1st thought teams have is about trading for him? Fucked up. http://t.co/4mB4QYQKKU http://t.co/i1uXbk36y7
Kane might just be going thru that 2nd season syndrome

@adampeacock3 @TheRealBozza @RobbieSlater17 Kane's best service in the 1st half came from the keeper! Says it all

@foofighters on our way to Edinburgh it's our son Kane's 21st -we brought him up on great music! Please say happy birthday.thanks guys
@gary302 agreed. Pay 30mill for Kane now or watch him bag 20+ and pay 50 mill in Jan ? The other 2 are going nowhere.

@nurfgunjake fingers crossed you see kane tomorrow got to meet up with your boyf
@robbieJBhood Kane walked off with a tight calf last saturday. If he starts i guess N'jie will be on the bench.
@thfc53 Lol. Does he seem like a Poch type of player? Or one that would fit in our wage structure? Or play 2nd fiddle to Kane? No.
"A mong he may be, but if Kane can produce last seasons form consistently then England have a goal scorer for 10+ years"
"Been enjoying playing Command and Conquer for it's 20th birthday.  Love the Commando, Love the Rockin' music and Kane, what's not to love!"

"Good finish from Kane, may not rate him that highly but he still scores"
Great save by Howard thought Kane got his 1st of the season then tho #EFC #COYB
Harry Kane may be a noble prince but he can't score goals without his army behind him aka WHY IS KANE ALWAYS ALONE UP FRONT CMON GUYS UGH
I am really hoping the #preds aren't one of the 5 teams that called about trading for Kane. Not sure we have enough room for 3rd chances.
"I like what I saw tonight, particularly in the 2nd half. 8 up/8 down. Let's keep rolling lads (hey Roy, you play Kane always) #England"
"I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/aCZISHWQI0 Josh Mathews questions the look AJ gave Kane: Raw June 4,"

Kane's teasing us with this shearer thing. Triple backflip into the corner flag at the stadium of light on Sunday
"Missed the game, but awesome that Kane scored. Should help a ton for Sunday.  #Confidence"
"My son is walkin out with the ENG team tomorrow night,told him under no circumstances can he b holding hands with Kane,am I right 2 say that"
Now I'm talking to my big sister and she's telling me that Kane's telling her he is going out on sat and I'm like yhhh I know with me
"Pat Brisson, the agent for #Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane, said Tuesday he believes Kane is innocent of any crime ( Per @ESPNChiPowers)"
Pretty sure Kane will interfere on Sunday in the Taker/Lesnar match and Taker wins then they have a rubber match and Les nar wins.
Sunday Supplement are honestly making out that Kane is one of the best strikers in the world.  He isn't even the best striker at Tottenham.

@Phoenvvx sure. Even Kendrick lost it towards the end of his Black Friday freestyle ( and this isn't me hating).
@SmittyGotNoHoes it's the coaching fault how is Kendrick not rushing the passer anymore on 3rd down ? Like Cox not our best option
@yomilo when we make that restaurant the picture of the ruby yacht beating Kendrick shall hang on the with our 1st dollar
Both dope songs but Kendrick has a message Future just goin dumb on auto tune  https://t.co/pqIhnFhFNR
Cole clearly said him and Kendrick aren't doing anything. So whatever he's dropping in February isn't what you think.
Damn dawg you weak ass niggas are really berating Kendrick. https://t.co/svYNcP7SqN
Honestly only bad thing I can say about the Kendrick album were the roll out of singles and what ones were picked 1st
How cam called obj over to him was just as disrespectful when Kendrick called out Cole 1st and last name on control and not everybody else
"I fucks with Kendrick, but March Madness deserve to be our national anthem it's that cold"
I'll hate on Kendrick all fucking day but that Black Friday freestyle is fucking legendary

J. Coles verse in Black Friday was kinda disappointing but Kendrick killed it
Kendrick made sure iggy wasn't going to steal his bars when he snapped on Black Friday.
Kendrick said a whole bunch of nothing on that Black Friday something but you people say e be verse of the moment.
"Kendrick the GOAT twitter ""All females hoes"" twitter  https://t.co/YXd3f1psRg"
"Kendrick's ""u"" and The Social Experiment's ""Sunday Candy"" are two songs that make my allergies act up when I hear them."
Kendrick's 2015 album may be important but it's not especially listenable. Future sounds like a guy playing with a microphone at Best Buy.
Let's be honest how many of ya sat down and listened to Kendrick's To Pimp a Butterfly? Cause I skimmed through it once and turned it off
Lmao I thought Kendrick was about to play Black Friday and I freaked out but nah
"My first time hearing ""Black Friday"" was yesterday.. Kendrick and Cole both murdered it"

"Someone commented on Black Friday by Kendrick and Cole and wrote, ""Once I saw these niggas looking homeless I knew fire was on the way."" Lol"

While we're on the topic.... J. Cole &gt; Kendrick   As far as Black Friday is concerned... Go debate ya fat aunt who only wears elastic pants
Why can't Kendrick rap on every song like he did Black Friday. Old Kendrick is better.
Yo it's been 2 and a half weeks since Kendrick's Black Friday dropped and I still haven't fully understood all his lyrics yet...

Black Friday by Kendrick is probably the best song I've ever heard
Black Friday is one of the best songs Kendrick has done
Black Friday x Kendrick and J Cole oh my goodness I can't stop playing it
But I think the weekend or Kendrick may possibly get album of the year
But tomorrow is my day off so I'll be alright (Kendrick voice)

Can't wait for February Kendrick and Cole about to kill it
"Can't wait for the picture of Kendrick holding 11 Grammys to surface so I can be like ""this is for the people in March calling TPAB trash"""
"Charles Hamilton ""Black box"" is on Friday only if he was focused he would have been up there with cole and Kendrick"

"I don't fuck with Kendrick like that at all, but he slayed this: https://t.co/Y8TMOFjrfd"

"I've been listening to J Cole's and Kendrick's Black Friday.I mean even if it isn't a collaborative project, let the niggas drop some fire."
Idk how on earth I'm going to get through April 14th without Kendrick and Oscar
"If I could make the Logic and Future shows in March and a Kendrick show, I'd be content."
If Kendrick and Cole drop they're album in February watch Drake drop his a week after just to kill there buzz. That would smart marketing
If you haven't heard Black Friday by Kendrick and J Cole I suggest for you to listen to it.
If you haven't heard black Friday by jcole and Kendrick. Please allow your ears to have orgasms.
"If you like rap and don't like Kendrick's ""Black Friday"", news flash: you don't really like rap"

Super-happy for Kendrick today but the reality is he'll lose 90% of those nominations in February and then it's back to hating the Grammys.
That wasn't even the day I wanted to go most and it was insane can't wait for Kendrick tomorrow
The Black Friday remixes by Kendrick and Cole are the exact reason I can't wait for their joint album
"The way J-Cole and Kendrick are teasing the world for the their collab album, with Black Friday is just faaaaya!!!"
There is going hard and than there is Kendrick in Black Friday.
"Top 5 MC's right now gotta be Kendrick, Cole, Rocky, Big Sean, and an unfilled 5th spot. Knights on the Mic."
Wale's content may have similarities to TPAB's but the difference is Kendrick executes it EXTREMELY better
"Was listening to Kendrick's ""Black Friday"" and I'm pretty sure it took my Call of Duty online to a entirely new level.."

#USOpen Anderson beat Murray in the 4th round. It's Murray's earliest Grand Slam exit in 5 years
@SkySportsTennis Murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing Djokovic
@SkySportsTennis it's a joke! Troicki v young into a 5th set and on Sky go we are forced to watch Murray walking into the practice court???
@cake_sports Haven't seen it yet. Caught end of Murray loss lights and interview. SVP is that dude though. 1st show.
@maxcouch @roryjiwani @Alex_0wen @DanBarberTF @Tennisratings Murray will never win a slam again unless he changes. 2nd serve a joke
Anderson absolutely killed Murray in the 4th set tie break 7-0 to win the match. How embarrassing for Murray
Andy broken to start the 3rd set; still complaining to chair ump that 5 minutes is excessive bathroom usage time. Murray's so done. #USOpen
Beginning to worry Murray may be stuck on two grand slams for the rest of his career.
"Booo, Murray gets broke early in the 2nd set. It's not as if he's playing bad, Anderson is playing exceptional tennis here. #USOpen"
I LOVE how aggressive both Serena &amp; Venus are being off the 2nd serve return. Murray would lose this match! @cbfowler @bgtennisnation
If Murray loses this 2nd set I'm pretty sure he won't win this.
Murray about as dead as the aliens in Independence Day on July 4th in #America. They die in the movie either way but worse on the 4th. #Dead
Murray always struggles on Louis Armstrong. How pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to  lose his mini break in the 1st?
Murray been broken in the 3rd. Unreal. Straight sets loss would make my day
Murray blew it! Just couldn't handle Anderson's first serve in the 4th set.
"Murray in real trouble now, down a break in the 3rd #USOpen Looking angry and frustrated"
"Murray is beaten before the QF of a Grand Slam for the first time in five years. Anderson, magnificent throughout, took 4th set tiebreak 7-0"
Murray misses a good chance to break at the start of the 4th. Sloppy along with a brilliant shot from Anderson denies the break. #USOpen
"Murray with a splendid array of swear words at the end of the 2nd set. Sitting there with the commentator having to say, ""sorry.  sorry."""

Woeful start to the 3rd from Murray. Think this is lights out for him.
"15-30 on Murray's serve, but the Scot more up than down finally and grabs the hold of serve with a couple of aces.  Andy up 4-3* 3rd set."
4th set point in this game and  challenge called in. Anderson 2-0 sets. Murray much more promising at the end of the 2nd. He's not out yet!
@Betweenthehedge @VivianJo1 @cosmosmom1952 Don't you just love them to pieces?!?! Murray is my 3rd. I can only handle one at a time tho. lol
@BrainGameTennis If Murray takes 3rd set I think he'll win
@DareToHart i'm not a huge fan myself but you know Murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp; 4th set knowing him.
"@GolfYeezus @S1NGH7 yeah Murray 1st/2nd, sproles for the 3rd down td lol"
"@Joannalangfield Concerned. If Murray can win this 3rd set, I think/hope he can win the match :)"
"@JoshCollacchi to be honest, I'd let Murray run it every time, even on 4th and 35, than let Trey throw."
"@KCChiefs_58 well, I think KC may have a good QB for the future in Murray."
@LewisKing__ @LouisWhyman @DCBlueStar I'm saying Murray was good but it great. Randle and dmc are just as good if it better. CM is 4th RB
"@Linda_Grace74 I can't see the tennis either, gutted I never sat the football but it looks like it's sky again for Murray?"
@MurrayBarnett thanks for hosting us Murray. Had a great time. Good luck for the cup. May the best team win. They usually do.
@ScottSFTC I wish I had seen your picks earlier after the day I had!!! Murray won 3-0 so your 2nd pick didn't hit. GL
"@SeanTierneyTSS If Murray comes back well, he'll be the 2nd/3rd best D maybe Johnson. I'd want him for the Leafs for sure."
@SkySportsTennis it's why I love tennis. One minute looks like murray is down and out. Next minute anything is possible! C'mon @andy_murray
@SkySportsTennis the later i stay up the better...c'mon Murray!
@andy_murray knows how to wring my nerves! Talk about tension and it's only the 1st set :-) Brilliant stuff. Behind you all the way Murray!
@andy_murray wins 3rd set to get back into the match but @kevinanderson18 still leads 6-7 3-6 7-6 Murray has won 8 times from 2 sets down.
"@kevinanderson18 you're serving big tonight, you'll play Murray on Monday and you'll struggle to get your first serves in play."
"@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!"
@serialsockthief Definitely although I think if Murray does enough to win the 4th set he'll go on and win it.
"@tgawd____ trash OL? Theyve looked excellent so far. Trash RBs?J-Stew ran for 486 yards in the final 5 games last season, 2nd only to Murray"
@usopen Ofcourse! Looking forward to Murray's 4th round game against the big-serving Anderson. A potential 5-setter. #usopen #nightshift
A good  hold from Murray. 5-3 in 2nd. How is Anderson's head coping with this now?
A lot has happened while I was away sprain-spraying my ankle. Murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins &amp; is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd.
Anderson beats Murray in the 4th round #USOpen2015 excellent game. #WellPlayed. http://t.co/Z2dFO2XQCs
Anderson stopped at the donation station. Murray on way back from 2 sets down!! C'mon Andy!
Anderson takes a toilet break. He's up 2 sets but doesn't really have the momentum. Murray finished 2nd set stronger.
Assuming Murray pulls it out here all 4 matches on Monday will be very intriguing.
Bellucci played a great 3rd set but Murray was just too good. He advances into week 2 with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 7-5 win #TeamMurray #usopen
Best of luck @kevinanderson18 on 4th rd @usopen vs Murray! Wish I was there to cheer you on. Go Illini!
Biggest game of the match. Even bigger than the 3rd set tie-break. Murray simply had to hold. Please Andy.
But! Murray takes the tie break in the 3rd set and we've got GAME ON! http://t.co/tzKVTmQMkL
Call on the field is reversed as the Aggies came up short of the 1st down. Murray and crew will go for it.
"Christine Michael is probably the 6th best RB in the division behind Murray, Mathews, Sproles, Morris, and Mostert."
Come on @andy_murray!! Tempted to make my way across to Flushing Meadows on Wednesday if Murray comes back to win here! #USOpen
Come on Murray dig deep...I'm going to be tired for work tomorrow if I have to stay up for a 5-setter @SkySportsTennis
"Crew gets a fumble at the 4, Murray and the O can't punch it in. Kick a FG to make it 17-7. May be Murray's team now. Crew has been awesome."
Get in!! Murray take the 3rd!! (Anderson leads 7-6 6-3 6-7) #USOpen2015
Good straight sets win for Murray last night hope he kicks on from here and good chance of winning the #USOpen for a 2nd time
Got Murray at 7. Surprised but my cousin took Antonio Brown at #2. Rodgers fell to me in the 2nd. Stashed Foster away in the 7th. Love it.

I can't believe Murray has to play on the junior varsity court in the 4th round of the U.S. Open
If this goes all the way to the 5th.... Odds lie with Murray to take the match. #usopen #SSTennis
"It may only be the round of 16, but holy cow! Don't tell that Anderson and Murray! Incredible match! 3hrs and 40min so far. #USOpen2015"
"Just as I say how good Anderson has been, Murray goes 3-1 up in the 3rd. Of course. #USOpen"
"Last two service games started well only to be whittled away at. Still, Murray wins second game on the trot to make it 3-5 in 2nd set."
"Lets go Andy! Murray wins the 3rd set, down 1-2. #usopen #andymurray"
Morning from #Woking where it is a dull start but hoping for sun to break through later. Couldn't stay up for end of Murray's match. :(
Mr. Murray gave me some really great life advice in the 7th grade and I was too much of a little douchebag to appreciate it.
"Murray 6-3 6-2. First set 50mins, 2nd 34. Bellucci's fine start, belief, fading fast, Murray steady with flashes of his best, like SP pass."
"Murray breaks again!! Back to back breaks in the 3rd set, Game face on!"
Murray d. Bellucci 6-3 6-2 7-5. Much better play from the start compared to his last match. Very tamed match. Into 4th round. #USOpen
Murray does well to hold. 5-4 to Murray. Anderson to serve to stay in the 3rd set #USOpen
Murray gets the break he needed. Even's things in the 3rd. Anderson has 3 sets to fail if Murray hopes to win.
Murray has decided to only hit Aces. Already 4 and it's just his 2nd game !!
Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray
"Murray is outshooting St. Mary 6-4 in the 21st minute, but still no score."
Murray must must must win this game on Anderson serve to turn the tide and give him something for the 3rd to build on #USOpen
Murray now holds to love and he levels the 4th set at 5-5. Pressure straight back on Anderson. His longest match at the Open #USOpen
Murray on the verge of being Scottish again for the 2nd time in a week.......
Murray seals the 2nd set 6-2 #USOpen2015 #USOpen #easy
Murray stays alive! He wins the 3rd set 7-6! #USOpen #tennis
Murray struggling at moment but I think he'll come strong in 3rd &amp; 4th set to take it to decider #USOpen2015

"Sumlin says he put Kyler Murray in for Kyle Allen during 1st half as a ""change of pace quarterback."" That pace: Fast. Murray has some wheels"
Superb from Anderson. Good fight from Murray as always. 2nd serve just ain't strong enough imo.

This Murray vs Anderson match is great. 4 hour match and it's still in the 4th set.
Two aces for Murray who holds for 4-3. Another Brit on court -- @JoKonta91 just starting v @Petra_Kvitova 2-1 to Czech 1st set on Ashe
WE HAVE THE BREAK ! Murray breaks Bellucci to 30. Serving for the 1st set at 5-3 !
"We're going to a 4th set!! Murray just dominated that tiebreak, wins it 7-2. He's pumped up now!! #USOpen2015 #Murray"
What an effort from Murray in that 2nd set. Got to take the momentum from the last few games into the 3rd. #USOpen
"With an ace, Murray takes the 3rd set 7-6(2)  but still trails Anderson 1-2."
Wow!! Just waking up to this. Saw it up to 2-1 Murray in 3rd set. Anderson was unbelievable; incredible win. https://t.co/Txqzz5PUrr

I need to go to sleep I have school tomorrow and I have to wake up at the crack of niall's white cracker ass
I'm so ready to annoy everyone at school tomorrow about Niall fracturing his foot
"May: ""why does RBB have a baby bottle?""  Me: ""obviously something to do with Louis unless Niall got a golf club pregnant."""
Niall had sex gave you tickets thats not love love is when he protects u he takes u on dates he wouldnt put u in the 7th row of the concert
Niall has the worst luck 1st this bitch got a prosthetic leg and now a fractured foot ://
Niall's pants are always so tight he may just be that size :(
So apparently a girl hooked up with Niall and he gave her 7th row tickets smh what a cheap bitch where those front row tickets @
"This fandom's a mess omg, I wouldn't be surprise if tomorrow there's a trend who says Niall's going to marry his cousin #WeKnowTheTruth"
When September 13 comes along I know I'll be forgotten..  just don't be surprised when Niall gets assassinated
Why are Niall and Camila even trending?? I bet Directioners are just really bored!! GO STUDY!! YOU HAVE SCHOOL ON MONDAY!!
"funny cause that asshole from the sun said ""niall confirmed the sun story"" like fuck no HE DID NOT"
if i sat beside niall i would be so annoyed bc he looks like he chews his gum annoyingly loud  http://t.co/Zc5NPTGJgD
"remember when that woman was ""giving birth"" during that prank and Niall just fucking sat there"
"#NEW #UPDATE  Liam , Harry and Niall will celebrate Liam's 22nd birthday at Topgolf tonight!!"

@irishkingnjh when Niall and I date I'll take them three out for dinner on the 14th and I'll just take them out once instead of three times
@littlestkinglou may I have a dm with Niall?:))
"@lookatnialler   That was Toronto I believe. I was about two feet to the left here, 4th row. When Niall threw himself to the floor, wow!"
@niallmyangelboy: Niam teased a song off the 5th album. such a tease..Look at Niall how cute he is.. ! https://t.co/UQ6J3qQiTI little shit

@savesnjh I got inspiration from Niall in the 2nd outfit bc all he wears is a stripped shirt &amp; black pants ok
All I want in life is to meet Niall tomorrow but I'm 10000% sure that won't happen
All i want for my birthday is a tweet from Niall or Louis.on The.9th @NiallOfficial  @Louis_Tomlinson
C'mon guys even if Niall and Camila are dating it's not bad.
"Camila may be on Niall's Instagram, but I'm on Harry's Instagram in his Baltimore picture. Kind of just gonna say I'm the winner here. :/"
Can we talk about the fact that I literally fell for Niall on Saturday.
Fans bought Niall a guitar to give to him at the OTRA Gillette show September 12! http://t.co/nXUqGvmQhQ
Goodnight friends I love you and Niall and I can't wait to sEE THE BOYS AGAIN TOMORROW AHHHHDNFCN

I had a dream yesturday that I went to a one direction concert and sat front row and Niall waved to me and he hopped off stage and hugged me
I have to do an all about me project ik what is this 5th grade? but anyways I have to list my accomplishments and my only is a Niall follow
I hope I meet the boys on Saturday &amp; I hope Niall follows me &amp; @niaIloncraic &amp; @blackbownjh !!!!!
I hope Liam comes out tonight with balloons like Niall did for his 21st but on his arm how cute was that
I hope Niall is fine :(( Let's just give him the space he wants and hope he'll be back on his track tomorrow.
I hope Niall's day was better than the other day.hope tomorrow goes good also
I love waking up from a long ass dream of meeting Niall...........(it was so real and different than Sunday morning I'm soooo)
I may have only made 5 second eye contact with Niall but I feel like he understands me now
I met Camila back in April. My DNA on her hands. I love hanging out with Niall
I miss Niall so much he made me so happy on Saturday I felt at home and god I want to go back
I want to make a shirt with Niall's tweet and wear it every Monday
I was thinking about Niall and how he was really cute at 16 and then I remembered his 22nd birthday is in five days and I can't cope with it
"I'm mainly just waiting on Cameron's on the 8th, Jack G's on the 10th &amp; then Niall's on the 13th"
"I'm phone is going to died so goodnight i will be back tomorrow if i have time see you guys tomorrow goodnight to Harry,Niall,Liam, Louis"
Is it pointless for me to try to get a Niall follow? I may be part Irish but I swear I have no luck so I can't see it ever happening.
Looooong day. Can't wait to see Niall tomorrow :)
"Louis and Harry love home Sunday roast. Liam loves curry, while Niall loves all the food in general"
Louis was so cute when he was sat next to Niall at the last concert and he kept making him laugh and was all giggly with him
"Luckily the boys don't have a show tomorrow, really hope Niall will feel better soon :("
"New wish time :) 12.00 he meets harry, liam, niall and louis and his surgery goes well https://t.co/vZGyqp0jnT"

"Niall is probably going to see 5sos tomorrow in NJ, love my luck :))"
"Niall is so beautiful his blue eyes, his smile he shines like a star or a sun he makes my day he's just so unconventionally beautiful."
Niall is so freaking cute j can't just imagine him sat there on his phone/laptop scrolling through all our tweets and laughing to himself
Niall on april 24th 2015 the best day he looked so good
Niall posted a pic of his hairy leg in the sun and im like wtf the fuck why so I scrolled and there was Zayn's beautiful face thank u
"Niall will follow me One Day  That day just isn't today, maybe tomorrow? @NiallOfficial"
"Niall's 22nd is coming way to early! I'm seriously so speechless,just always know that I'm here for ya!  @NiallOfficial @NiallOfficialPH"
Niall's charity drive for @autismdogsirl is at 44% now! Donate and spread the word please! Just a few more days!  https://t.co/XXNN2plPj7
"Niall's going to be 22 in 12 days NO ONE'S GONNA BE 22, I'LL LOCK HIM IN FOREVER21!1! *prepares squad* C'mon!"
Niall's laugh at the end of that snapchat is honestly the 2nd best part of the best snapchat every recorded
"On Niall's birthday on Sunday the 13th, we should all tweet a video on why we love and appreciate him. #HappyBirthdayNiall"
SEPTEMBER 5 so it means 8 days to go  before Niall's birthday huhu and 9 days to go before Cj's Birthday i miss this girl so much huhu

"We may call Liam dad but let's be real, Niall is dad. Always havin a chat with people, checkin up on the wife and fam."
What's this? - you may ask. It's a fan project for Niall's birthday!  Want to get noticed by Niall? Make a video! http://t.co/9i4KyBzj8l
Why is everyone talking about Niall's bday it's not until the 13th ok I have 8 more days until I panic bc he's 22
Why is no one talking about the fact that Niall's birthday is almost here. Or the fact the boys can drop the 5th album any day now
"by tomorrow, my layout will hopefully consist of a selfie with Niall and otra fireworks fingers crossed people"
do you know that moment when you stare at the sun and your eyes start to cry because it's so bright? that happens to me when i look at Niall
"do you remember when Niall sang ""Beautiful Girls"" in his 21st birthday, good times can he just sing that again like can he just do it please"

ok lame but i want to have a Niall birthday party on Sunday
ok let me just say the 4th clip where Harry is putting his hat on Niall.... AH HE LOOKS SO GOOD https://t.co/yEcVTZ7D4k
one time in the 7th grade I wrote Niall is daddy on my hand &amp; my teacher was yelling at me to show him what it said &amp; I licked/rubbed it off
please change the 10th ww trend into Niall and Bianca yes much better!
remember when niall played croke on my bday. he was soo happy!! day I found out I could officially go to wwa miami too. may 23rd. good day:)
the only thing brighter than the sun is Niall's smile -my brother just made my day
tmh change my mind when Niall waved at my section was the 2nd best day of my life after otra when I heard through the dark live
"tomorrow it's my birthday and well, it would mean the world to me if a specific guy names Niall would notice me @NiallOfficial"
"wanted to say that you're my beautiful little idiot, you may be as funny as Harry but it's cute. P.S: Niall loves his princess;) @cumlarry_"
"we don't get enough Niall in yellow, I don't like the color but he looks like the sun in it #MTVHottest One Direction"
@MileyCyrus I dreamed about katy perry dragging Nicki's back for you on sunday and it was very fatal. I hope it's gonna happen
"@Nicki_F @ThalesLives @scottedelman You may disagree Nicki, but the facts just don't support you. Nor does the vote by all of fandom."
@TMZ Miley may act and be the way she is but she is a good person. Nicki is the one looking for fights anywhere. Embarrassing...
"@itsbl0ndie I still think it was fake. I always thought Nicki to be the type to call you out on a random Tuesday, not at an awards show"
"@musicnews_shade azealia may not be the most famous rapper of all time but sadly, nicki's songs are in billboard for her physique not talent"
"@nice_feminist she may be a """"""""problematic fave"""""""" but there's NO reason for her to be getting dragged just cuz Nicki said some shit"
@rayshellbox Kasi nga diba may prejudice pa rin about black entertainers? Also Miley says that Nicki keeps pulling the race card--
"@spectralpixie nicki can't even get her 3rd album to go gold lmfao  Nicki copies off Kim's OLD shit, Kim was the first female with --"
"A no no, Kanye announces he's running for president, and nicki gets crazy with Miley all in the the same night.. It's Sunday wtf"
A woman called Nicki a wee bitch and spat because she sat down in front of her on the 11
"All Nicki said was ""what's good"" like c'mon now we get it she a bad bitch ok"
"And tomorrow Nicki is going to be seen as ""a raging angry black women"" for calling Miley out of something that she is GUILTY for"
Do you guys remember that not too long ago Nicki was like one of the most hated artist.. During her Pink Friday album
"I think Nicki made an ass out of herself last night. 1st you call the VMA's racist, 2nd then you perform and accept an award at the VMA's"
I'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and Nicki is being the shady bitch queen she is and I just lost all focus
"If Nicki didn't have her ass, she'd be shorter when she sat down."
If you think Nicki's ass is more than 1/8th real you are fuuucked
Kanye and Nicki are the reason they may have to do away with award shows. YOU say it's about artists but you two always make it about YOU.
"Literally 1st time I've ever watched the #VMAs. Miley called Nicki out on her CRAP, and I respect that. #sorrynotsorry #suckitupnicki"
Lost some respect for Nicki after that. You may be a queen in the rap world but when u start shit at an award show u look like garbage #VMAs
Miley has no tits &amp; ass but Kim and Nicki may have the same botox injection expert and Kim ain't got shit to lose. https://t.co/EEjrWcrHzw
"Miley is the 8th most hated person in America, idk why y'all are acting like Nicki gets more hate than Miley"
Nicki dead ass sat in our fAces and lied to us about meek. bye http://t.co/XTK1x0URvo
Nicki's butt is just too big like c'mon that's not even fun anymore like
"So whats good Miley? @MileyCyrus ...lol Nicki with that fuck shit,we may as well make a song about it. Hit me up. I ghost write like Quentin"
"This ain't the 1st day I've ever called Nicki ignorant, fuck. I'm on and off w/ her. Its simple, &amp; I don't always like how she handle shit."
Why is Nicki always calling someone out on stage .. Bitch looks so trashy while Miley just sat there and took what she said with class
Yall act like Nicki really Finna mess up Taylor's moment ............for the 2nd time again. #VMAs
i want mildew clitoris off my tl i dont want her anywhere near nicki i dont want to see her rat ass ever again launch her into the sun
"i'm tweeting this for the 2nd time, nicki needs to realize that people don't buy her music NOT BECAUSE SHE ISN'T ""SKINNY AND WHITE""+"
miley.. you better watch out for nicki backstage she may throw hands
tbh if tomorrow ppl start going after Nicki for what she said im gonna be pissed
@Iovemyths Watch: even tho that was Nicki responding 2 Miley putting her on blast 1st the media will make it out like Nicki picking a fight.
@Likeitornotmama @LILKIMQOR Its not... Nicki garnered the success she has today because of what her 2nd album entailed AND the look.
@Likeitornotmama @jda927 Lil Kim will be remembered as the 3rd/4th most successful female rapper. Nicki will/is the 1st. Numbers don't lie.
@LuxxSOCIAL @Raheem_TM it may have have gotten a higher score never denied that fact....but Nicki's album is STILL critically acclaimed. Lol
@NICKIMINAJ hey Nicki i was going to wish you happy independence on monday from Trinidad
"@NICKIMINAJ hey Nicki, wish me luck on my first day tomorrow ? Lol"
@NickiHunter happy humpday Nicki enjoy your Wednesday. Super love and miss you. Xoxo sweetpea
@TeaMasterT People need to full-stop stop using that for White characters. Full-stop. It's EXACTLY what Nicki criticized in the 1st place.
"@ZeusBarker true, but she was flapping her gums, I'm glad Nicki sat her down. Someone needed to show her what she said was foul."
@anaaheartbeat @Aliina57 I'm watching the red carpet for Nicki mostly. They're gonna air the show tomorrow night so I might go to bed after
@barkycarly @aimeeorleans I feel like I planned my whole day wrong. I gotta get ready for class tomorrow. BUT I JUSR T WANNA WATCH NICKI
"@e_jaculation but we mustn't forget that on the 7th day, God gave us a Nicki -- Miley take down of epic proportions. Rejoice my child."
"@gregnisall @ENews Anaconda video got 19 million views in 24 hours, so whatever you may think of Nicki personally, she has a point."
@kiaspeaks oh. I may have been watching a marathon of who do you think you are on tlc. Wasn't paying attention to Twitter. Good for Nicki!
"@mari_fminaj @THEQUEEN0FRAPI do not know, Pink Friday has the best song Nicki: Super Bass but the pinkprint has invincible like Anaconda"
"@n_embo @HogarthsWfield @ToastedOrange @jodiekins22 @OssettObserver Hullo Nicki! Thanks for invite, 'twas in the same venue last Wed!"
@nicki_belles @Siggy116 @Jgrizam22 @bryantbreck I like the attitude Nicki. I'm gonna do it tomorrow. If I figure out how to do it lol

me the first day of work: ok so I need off next Sunday I have tickets to see Seth Rollins
seth rollins is going to be in daytona on sunday and i need to be there.
"'There's no point to Sharknado, they may as well as had Slothnado. Sloths killing ppl with their hooks'"
@Ike58Reese or just watch something more meaningful than Sharknado!! Cmon man! May i suggest @neiltyson 's #cosmos - feed your brain yo
"@MattFossen @FrankConniff 1st, they did do Plan 9. 2nd, Sharknado is not earnestly bad, it's ironically so. That's why MST3K wouldn't work"
@yuu_naoyuki this is the 3rd one. Check Sharknado and Sharknado 2 too. XD it's horrible that it's hilarious. This is a really bad movie.
"A 60 mile flame burning hotter than the surface of the sun!?!  Come on Sharknado, that is even ridiculous for you."
All you people watching Sharknado tomorrow are they terrorists hate us.
How did Sharknado get a 3rd film? How did Sharknado even get a film to begin with? Life doesn't make much sense.
I am not in the right frame of mind to attempt to watch Sharknado 3 yet. I may need to start drinking.
I can't believe people really like Sharknado enough for them to make a 3rd part. So stupid.
"I don't even understand how Sharknado is even a thing, let alone having a 3rd movie. The SE suck, the acting sucks, and it's so dumb I laugh"
I dont understand the obsession with Sharknado.... watched the first two and they sucked. Im sure the 3rd one is just as bad.
"I figured Sharknado was played out at #2 &amp; tonight we get #3?   I won't be watching, just like the 1st 2"
I hate the Sharknado fandom. It's a poor imitation of so bad it's good. Also I  don't care if April lives #suckmynado
I sat through the whole of Sharknado 2 I'm pretty sure NS is nothing compared to that shit.
"I think Sharknado 3 may have jumped the shark, and gone too far down the make a bad movie road. The second half is just awful in a bad way."
I'm convinced listening to the Freak Show tomorrow morning will be WAY better than that Sharknado ending. @fsmikey @FSBigBob
It may be significant to some of those who enjoy movies with a cult following but Sharknado is a disgrace to the film industry
It sucks we live in a world where Sharknado is about to start a 4th sequel but we can't get a Tron 3 or Dredd 2.
Just starting to watch Sharknado 4 the 1st time. Craptacular already. Cc @beerlytweeting @hadyngreen
Okay the first Sharknado was funny but do we really need a 4th movie? I think I lost a few brain cells after watching the 3rd
"Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No, is that the movies title or just everyone's reaction when they heard a 3rd one was being churned out?"
"Sharknado 3 comes on tonight. Yes, a movie about a shark tornado has made it to a 3rd movie, and yes, I too have lost all faith in humanity."
Sharknado 3 may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.
Sharknado 3 may have overdone it just a little bit. And that's saying something for a Sharknado movie.
Sharknado is definitely the best of the worst. Come see the spectacle this Thursday at 6 &amp;9pm in the RH Theatre! http://t.co/lfOjKxaM9q
"Sharknado is one of the worst movies in existence, but I'm watching it for the 10th time for some unknown reason"
"Sharknado is the silliest film franchise so badly produced I cudnt stop laughing through the 2nd, I saw sharks flying n had to call it a day"
Sharknado may be the worst movie ever created
Sharknado may well be the flat out dumbest thing ever to occupy a TV screen.
Sharknado was funny the first time. We humored them for the 2nd. But a THIRD? Even I'm not enough of a fan of bad movies to watch that shit.
Shout out to @ZombeaversMovie for being the worst movie since @SharknadoSyfy... Sharknado has a chance to reclaim the title tomorrow...
"The 1st Sharknado was good, the 2nd bad and the 3rd was just pathetic. They are making a 4th, but I'm done with them now! #sharknado"
"The Great Wall of Sharknado, the 9th Wonder of the World. Oh, HELL NO! #Sharknado3"
The Zoo miniseries may be the worst collection of images &amp; sounds man has ever produced. We're talking Sharknado w/o the self-awareness.
The fact that there is a 3rd Sharknado is everything that is wrong with this world...   Lamer than my #LameJoke collection...   #Sharknado3
"Unfollowing anyone tweeting about Sharknado, may god have mercy on yr soul"
Who knew there were enough people in the world easily pleased by shite like Sharknado that they're getting a 4th instalment?!
Why does someone make the effort to produce a 3rd movie of Sharknado anyways lmao
may i just say the lighting in Sharknado 3 could use a little work?????
"#AprilLives because the gorgeous @TaraReid IS the franchise player! Aliens has Ripley, Sharknado has April!! #Sharknado3"
#ImNotSuperstitiousBut I have to watch Sharknado tonight and Sharknado 2 and the premiere of Sharknado 3 tomorrow. #SyFy

"2 things twitter: 1, Jack Daniels pairs very well with cherry juice and 2, Sharknado 3 may be the greatest movie ever."
22minutes until the Sharknado hits for the 3rd time. Oh Hell No!!!! #sharknado3 #Syfy #Toledo #BBN
"@Adam_Squid_Ward yo dawg, friendly reminder about Sharknado tomorrow. You still up to come?"
@GloriaChapa1 Sorry about the Sharknado 3 tweet. Forgot you must wait until Sat. to see it. Won't say any more but think you'll enjoy it.
@HenryJGomez People tweet a lot about Svengoolie on Saturday. It seems a lot like that with Sharknado!
@IAmJericho looking forward to watching you in Sharknado 3 tomorrow night !!

@SharknadoSyfy @HarveyLevinTMZ @TMZ Great movie Sharknado is the best one yet.Where is the audition for the 4th movie I want in.Great stuff.
@Simonjenkin #simonika hivemind!   We should watch sharknado tomorrow...it might just blow your mind #sorry #notsorry
@TaraReid  Never had a need for Twitter. Then Sharknado made the public responsible for April's life. Hope to see you in Sharknado 4.
@TaraReid I hope to see u in Sharknado 4! April just gave birth to a baby inside a freaking shark! she can survive everything! #AprilLives
@TaraReid I want April to Live to see SHARKNADO 4! #AprilLives

A happy fun loving Saturday 2 the wonderful @TaraReid true CHAMPION of Sharknado films an always shows the love 2 everyone across the world
"Also, Sharknado 3 tomorrow! Bring on the campy shark and theme park humor!"
April has to live. Sharknado wouldn't be the same without her tiny chainsaw. #aprillives
"April is the best part of sharknado! If April dies, Sharknado will jump the shark @TaraReid #AprilLives #Sharknado3 #OhHellNo #AprilLives"
"Bit behind the times, but Sharknado may be the best thing I've ever seen. #comedygold"
Cable here is running Sharknado (the 1st one) right now! This movie is the dumbest thing I've ever LOVED...
Can it just be tomorrow so I can see @CassieScerbo in Sharknado 3 #Sharknado3 #OhHellNo
Can't wait for tomorrow . . . won't have to hear about Sharknado anymore.
"Columbus friends, are any of you willing to go see the Sharknado 3 premier with me tomorrow night? Actual party downtown, not a theatre!"
"Cost of running the 1st advertisement in Sharknado 3 probably rivals the Super Bowl. Nice play there, @hotelsdotcom."
Dad said he can't go to party on the patio tomorrow because he needs to be home so he can watch Sharknado. Cool.
Enjoying Sharknado for the 3rd time in a row #Sharknado3
"Finally getting a chance to watch Sharknado 3. I liked the 1st one a lot and loved the 2nd one, so I've really been looking forward to it."
From the makers of the Sharknado franchise comes a new movie on Saturday called Lavalantula. I must see this.
George is LIVE tweeting during the premiere of Sharknado 3 tomorrow!  Join in! http://t.co/sPRT4dIn9L
Going to get drunk and watch the badness that is Sharknado 3. This is going to be a good Sunday night.
"Good Thursday morning, #Weatherhounds! Glad to see y'all survived the Sharknado outbreak more or less intact."
Hanging with my Monsters on a Saturday night watching Sharknado ! They love it ! #Sharknado3 http://t.co/ckzCiTZVlZ
Happy Sharknado 3 eve. May the plot be thin and the cameos ridiculous.
Hey @TaraReid Sharknado is all about April!! You better be in Sharknado 4 Team April all the Way! Tara U Rock! http://t.co/6uRApfph2q
Hey @billengvall:  can't wait for Sharknado 3 tomorrow night! What is the name of your character?  Woo hoo!!  @SharknadoSyfy #GaryMartinHays

"How's everyone's Saturday night? Don't lie. Ur laying in your bed with your smartphone up in the air, with Sharknado 3 in the background."
I can't wait to go to the beach then watch sharknado tomorrow
"I don't care if April is dead or alive, I just can't wait for Sharknado 4"
I got my sister's kids to watch Sharknado. They're asking about the 3rd one already
"I have grown to love @TaraReid's character, April, throughout the Sharknado franchise. #Sharknado3"
I have watched every Sharknado and have made plans to watch the 3rd one. Let's goooo
I hope I can catch Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No tomorrow night idc how bad it is
I just found out Sharknado 3 comes out tomorrow night. I'm beyond excited
I like Sharknado but I don't like the April character
"I like that there's no messing around in Sharknado, just action. You don't even have to wait 10 mins for the 1st sharky sequence! #OhHellNo"
I may get killed for this but I watched 15 minutes of pretty little liars. The girls acting ability is as good as the acting in Sharknado.
I may or may not have just DVR'd the Sharknado trilogy for Saturday. Can't wait to see what the hype is about. #sorrynotsorry
"I see Jimmy made it into sharknado, so wnci should be hilarious tomorrow."
"I want them to amp all the way up to an 11th Sharknado, then do 12th where two guys in shark costumes just reenact ""My Dinner With Andre."""
I want to see Sharknado 3.  Someone record it onto a DVD tomorrow and bring it to the track Thursday.
"I watched Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! today and it was really really awesome! Better than 2nd, better or on par with 1st. The Hoff on the moon!"
Id rather watch sharknado on repeat all day than have to get up at 5 tomorrow (:
"If I don't go to the gym tomorrow night, I can watch SHARKNADO 2 again. It has been too long since I watched."
If you're not planning to watch Sharknado 3 tomorrow then idk what you're doing with your life tbh
Is it weird I'm excited for Sharknado 3 tomorrow night?
It's the Saturday of a long weekend and I'm at home watching Sharknado. This is my new life.
It's time for Sharknado 3. We know how to live it up on Saturday night.
"JUST WATCHED SHARKNADO 3 AND HOLY SHIT THE END WITH APRIL, the giving birth in a shark is new to me.. #aprillives #sharknado3 @SharknadoSyfy"
"Jake and I will be in Sharknado 4. We may die in the first scene, but we'll be in it. #HollywoodDreams"
Just watched Sharknado 3 can't wait for the 4th
"LRT: I'm planning to watch Sharknado 3 tomorrow, but I just wanted to point out...um. NASA is tweeting about Sharknado."
Looking forward to Sharknado 3 tomorrow. Tara cant act her way out of a paper bag and her face can no longer show ANY emotion. I LOVE it!
"Loved the Today Show peeps on 3rd installment of ""Sharknado""!! @TODAYshow   @SharknadoFans"
Make sure to watch Sharknado 3 Hell No tomorrow! @maryse0uellet is in the movie! but you'll have to find her ;)
"May I be excused? ""To do what?"" ""So I can watch Sharknado?"" ""... Thank you for being honest."" My 11-year-old sister is cooler than me."
My brother's reaction to the end of Sharknado may be the single greatest thing i have ever witnessed. #epic
"My kids look forward to the Sharknado movies, because they are awesomely horrible....and we need April! #AprilLives"
My mom is really lecturing me about how Sharknado is such a good movie &amp; that everyone watches it which is why they came out with a 3rd one.
My plans were to Sharknado 1&amp;2 it up for tomorrow's big premiere... But OITNB won. 1/2way thru season 3.. I need more hrs in the day..
"Oh my god, Sharknado in space! This is even cooler the 2nd time! #Sharknado3"
"Oh you know, just making sure my schedule tomorrow allows me to watch SHARKNADO 3"
"Ok. Tonight ""Sharknado 3"", the 25th ""Lavantula"", oh you are so lucky US friends!"
"Our 7th and 8th graders had a blast at the ""Sharknado"" Back-to-School dance last night!!"
"Really has to start watching the Sharknado movies now. They'e already on 3 and announcing a 4th movie, and I have yet to see even 1 /o\"
"Really, this Sharknado cast may be the. Best since Boogie Nights."
SHARKNADO 3 tomorrow!??? Best day of my life
SHARKNADO TONIGHT!!! OHMYGOD I AM SO EXCITED even though I can't watch it til Saturday...
Sharknado 3 comes out tomorrow and I think I'm going to cry with happiness
Sharknado 3 may be the best film I've seen yet. #Sharknado3 #America

Sharknado triple feature tonight...Lavalantula with Police Academy star on Saturday!!!  Scyfy channel is on fire!
Sharknado's on!!! Then the 2nd one! Then #ohhellno #3 at 9. Shoulda left work early.

Sharknado3 tomorrow night! The original Sharknado is on tonight at 9:00 in case you've been living under a rock. Only on Syfy #BestMovieEver
So I notice on SyFy website you can vote if April lives or dies in Sharknado 4. Essentially they announced Shaknado 4... What a great day!
So... Uh guys. Sharknado is tomorrow. Would anyone wanna celebrate it with me on WadaTwitter
Sorry I can't make it in to work tomorrow got caught in a SHARKNADO

Think I may have fallen in love with @CassieScerbo only 30 minutes into Sharknado 1 ha.
This VMA drama is just trying to distract us from Sharknado 3 tomorrow
This may be pathetic but I'm soo excited for Sharknado 3. Best to watch with lil kids tho.
This may be the best Sharknado of all Sharknado's ! Loving #Sharknado3
Tricking my mom into watching Sharknado and Sharknado 2: The Second One before the party tomorrow night #Sharknado3

Wasn't gonna watch Sharknado tonight but I may have to catch a peak to see @keselowski @joeylogano and the @NASCAR crew
Watched Sharknado tonight with mom while she recovered from surgery. Now she wants to watch 2 and 3 tomorrow. I love my mom.
Watching Sharknado is the only call with #Sharknado3 coming tomorrow
Watching Sharknado waiting for the 3rd one at 9
Watching Sharknado with Kaden. This is the 2nd one I guess... surprising.
Watching the original Sharknado prepping for #Sharknado3 tomorrow.
We are 5 minutes in on Sharknado 3 #OhHellNo and already I think this may be the most impactful movie since Schindler's List
What Ebert said about the FRIDAY THE 13th series is actually true of SHARKNADO: whatever you say about one can stand for all of them.
Who else is going to be singing the Sharknado soundtrack at work tomorrow? #Sharknado3
Why am I watching Sharknado 3 for the 3rd time this weekend?
"Yes, Sharknado 4 Is Happening: Sharknado 3 had barely premiered Wednesday night before the studio annou... http://t.co/cOFUH1T4Gv (Time)"
You'd think with as successful a franchise as Sharknado they could splurge a little on the crappy cgi for this 3rd installment.
answered all requests but signing off for the night it is time for Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No! see you all tomorrow
but today is one direction's 5th anniversary  sharknado 3 is coming and cory tweeted about sharknado and makes me wanna cry im so emotional

@GenieBowl Like Tyler and Luke's teams with Josh and Devin close behind. Hate Shawn's team. If I had to choose a 2nd worst team it's Dustin.
@jdilley_3 Harvey and Shawn have put me on the no access list along with Bo and Carl Pelini. Otherwise I'd be there tomorrow.

"Shawn literally is like:""show tomorrow ! Tickets on sale right now go get them "" like thanks for the warning ..."
"Shawn makes me so happy nobody understands, you may think you do, but you don't."
Shawn may be young but acts so mature and thats one of the things you should love about him
Shawn will be at the VMAs tomorrow and I'll be at the red carpet so ill be updating myself
Shawn will be attending the VMAS tomorrow! #confirmed
Shawn with little kids may just be the cutest thing on the face of this planet http://t.co/yl69jKxKEU
"Shawn's a smart guy, he may be young but he knows what he's talking about."
So Shawn is meeting up with the jacks tomorrow I'm expecting some hot ass pics
So can I skip school tomorrow and go to the city to see Shawn the Jacks &amp; Justin
So glad Shawn has a show Wednesday night if he came to jack and jacks show I would not be on stage
"Sunday Kombat ch 35! Best thing about Sunday's Shawn, looking forward to reading it.  https://t.co/MGKLQSimv9"
Thanks very much Shawn! I hope you're having a great Monday! https://t.co/FYhZT554UJ
The first time I ever watched Shawn on tv was on Michael and Kelly and now he's gonna be on the show tomorrow I'm emotional
Tomorrow Shawn is going to be an hour away from me and I can't go see him my heart hurts
"Tomorrow is going to be my tenth time seeing Shawn perform, I'm so lucky to be able to even once, this is so insane"
Tomorrow it'll have been one year since I saw shawn live for the first time
Tomorrow will be one year since I've seen/ met Shawn for the first time

love how she is always with my favorites like 1st Shawn and now Niall
omg then I sat on my floor in front of the TV and bawled over Shawn when he was performing on that one show
really sucks that if I didn't have school tomorrow I would've been able to see shawn tonight
seeing shawn tomorrow is the only thing that's getting me through the day.
so mad I have school this week... if I didn't I would be in NYC because Shawn has a show tomorrow and the jacks have one the day after
so on Friday I wore my Shawn shirt I got at the concert &amp; everyone was complimenting me &amp; telling me how much they loved him it was cute -a
"someone teach me their ways, seriously need to meet Shawn when he comes to NYC on sept 8th"
the only time I haven't put on foundation is when I met Shawn for the 3rd time it was great
"the other day in class I told this girl I like shawn and she says ""he's not that hot."" 1st, yes he is. 2nd, even if he wasn't I don't care."
tomorrow will mark a year since i saw shawn live for the first time
v sad bc a bunch of people are meeting Shawn in San Diego and I'm laying in my couch watching the day after tomorrow in Spanish
wait for the island show tomorrow is Shawn gonna be doing his full set or just some songs
"yes. it may have ruined my social life, but I don't regret finding out about Shawn one bit. https://t.co/83EQLZphXG"
you may not like them together but admit it camila and shawn sounds amazing together

"@TimesOfIndia btw how much money you charged from ""eminent people"" to make Yakub's headline a prominent one ??? https://t.co/z586zvUrsA"
"@UnSubtleDesi @digvijaya_28  If Congree rule at this time, Yakub may be on street with the help of 40 Ami Chando."
@_sabanaqvi btw yakub was a good terrorist !! may he never rest in peace ..
@abpnewstv why ABP is telecasting Yakub family interview.  It is to get the sympathy.  ABP may be hanged along with YAKUB
@arunvipra @mediacrooks @_sabanaqvi is wrong: Dr APJ the ex-President passed on July 27; Yakub the terrorist was hanged till death on Jul 30
@asadowaisi Go &amp; try your best to save him but we will make sure that bloody Yakub will be dead by July 30th !!!
"@brownbrumby Agree with 2nd part,but Yakub is no reason. Best logical argument against his hanging by @Raghav_Bahl. @YRDeshmukh @asadowaisi"
@dna Yakub's guilt has been proved &amp; pardon plea rejected. Why should a sane man spk it now. Excusing pseudo-innocent may encourage criminal
"@ibnkhabar  this people who try  to save ""YAKUB""  may be with DAUD  n   CHUHA TIGER""...GADDAR GANG"""
"@kavita_krishnan @sagarikaghose tomorrow morning u will get reply, yakub will be hanged. India is not going to be govern by presstitutes,"
@kkalpu  Oh.14 days is there?   Thanks for the information. Any way this is the 2nd mercy petition. This has no value.  Yakub has to hang
"@mihirssharma Hey fucker! Cry as much u want.Ur ""bother"" Yakub is going to be hang tomorrow.Suck it bitch."
@narendramodi Citizens are confused on Yakub undoubtedly he is a traitor and 2nd is he is traitor turned informer .... let RAW win.
@ndtv Y don't u ask ur reporters to collect pottys of Yakub menon so tomorrow you can sell it as Secular fertiliser..rubbish reporting shame
"@tajinderbagga No issues if he is saving an innocent of any religion, but Yakub killed hundreds of innocent, tomo Bhushan may back ISIS too!"
"@tathagata2 you are right,  Yakub's mourners may be the supporters of terrorism,  they should be under scaner."
"@tehseenp I just can't believe ppl like you exist, why don't u and Yakub just elope to Pakistan.https://t.co/9V4LKjh2Wb"
@the_hindu May be but now it seems inevitable. Looks like pay back time  for Yakub!
@timesofindia  it was deplorable to say the least of you to dedicate almost 3 pages to Yakub &amp; ironically Mr. Kalam on 5th page. SAD day
Actually today was Yakub's birthday. I wish him many many returns of this day. May he hang in hell too.!!
"All those who petitioned for stopping Yakub's hanging , may hang themselves ...This would be the best  ""Shraddhanjali"" to him"
"And like all those left behind by the 257 people he helped kill, hope Yakub's daughter finds peace &amp; a better world. She turns 21 tomorrow."
Bajrangi Bhai jan I do agree with you brother should not be hanged for brother.  But Mr. Yakub is also accused...... https://t.co/vXYiDJSBaU
But it's nothing that 257 families lost their family members because of Yakub.  https://t.co/U8A37eWphV
Conviction of Yakub by highest courts is being 2nd guessed by the likes of @sagarikaghose with zero knowledge of law. Contempt of court?
Daring Jrn'sm yes @arunjaitley fumbled @sardesairajdeep is not with Yakub or agst Babu/may but for all mass killers  https://t.co/eYzXZ0pX54
"Death threat to Justice Dipak Misra who refused Yakub's mercy petition""irrespective of the protection you may avail, we will eliminate you."""
Final decision about death should be made after the arrest of tiger memon..may be tiger forced to yakub for doing that...
Happy to see cogent views from most of the section of society. Yakub was a terrorist. Capital punishment may be a... http://t.co/G1SenGgr9S
Hats off to Dupreme Court who sat till early morning n did not allow attempt to postpone the hanging of Yakub.
Highly disappointed with @timesofindia : Yakub's last rites on 1st page news whereas Dr.Kalam who was laid to rest at ramehswaram on page 13
"I guess, SP or Congress ruled States may create TERRORISTS WELFARE MINISTRY soon. Yakub's wife will be the 1st minister"
"I may sound cruel, be it, it's nice to have terrorists like Yakub languishing in prison, dying bit by bit, before actually being hanged..."
"I think aftr seeing all this #YakubToHang drama, the security guy at d jail would like to shoot Yakub dead rather than hanging him tomorrow"
"I want to hear yakub dead, when I wake up tomorrow #HangYakub"
I wish Mani Shankar Aiyar commit suicide tonight to meet Yakub tomorrow in hell
"If Indian agencies just lookout for who were in contact with these people trying to save Yakub, they may end up finding all conspirators !"
If Yakub is not dead by this time tomorrow- let the judges who delayed it pay for his upkeep.My tax money is not meant to for terrorists
"If v leave Yakub today, tomorrow again he ll kill 257 innocent people. What kind of justice,is it?#YakubDebate"
"It has become a wrong trend to protect the person who has been punished by SC &amp; President,without any 2nd thought Yakub be hanged#YakubDebat"
"Kurian Joseph, who raised stupid doubts about modi's good friday meet, now questions about yakub's death penalty.Some ppl never learn"
LOL Too clever by half! Your daddy was disappointed over Yakub's hanging &amp; he was a dreaded terrorist! Get it?  https://t.co/9hMx66BwmJ
Lakh of cases R pending in supreme court even than Yakub's case being heard 6/7th time today as if there no work in court.public want answer
Leftist communists want it rewritten to show Yakub as an innocent saviour unlike what was originally written!   https://t.co/upxML7XfCg
Liberals supporting Yakub today are the same guys who will support ISIS tomorrow..
"May I know @ArvindKejriwal, Do you have any proof that Yakub is Innocent? #AAPWithTerrorists"
"No media Hallah no Julush for  late sepoy Rachpal Singh. Or it may be he is not terorist like Yakub .""narendramodi http://t.co/J1EKydKPYf"
One may argue if hanging Yakub was right or wrong. But the people who are trying to portray him as a communal hero are purely anti-national
"People seeking mercy for Yakub, Hope this Punjab terror attack may jolt you out of stupidity into reality #Gurdaspur"
"Persons who are favoring Yakub Menen, may be HAPPY on Gurdaspur Attack. Those persons should also be hanged till death along with Yakub."
"Pranab Mukherjee has just again rejected Yakub's 2nd mercy petition, hanging would be on as per schedule at 7am tomorrow #HangYakubNow ."
Salman you may be a celebrity but that doesn't mean you have the licence to say Yakub is innocent.Just stick to acting.
"Salman's views in favour of Yakub can be usedby prosecution in hit n run case tp prove him not a law abiding citizen,it may cost him dearly"
So Yakub's wife was lying when she said we know nothing about Tiger Memon.  http://t.co/gfz3Ykfqtg
"Spare me the nuances, Yakub is certainly not innocent. Rarest of the rare case? May be! #YakubToHang"
Still not clear whether Yakub will be hanged Thursday! One more challenge to his death sentence in the SC
Stupid view completely one sided. Do you think we enjoyed media bias on Yakub death sentence?  https://t.co/EPAxKxoUaQ
"The Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon hanged.  Seculars may sign a petition to declare Yakub as a ""good terrorist"" as he died on his b'day."
The march of ISIS seems to have begun in India with Yakub's funeral. They want to wave off murder of 257 on mere repentance?
"Tiger Memon rang up family on July 30 before Yakub's hanging: Instead of grieving for his brother who was about to die, Tiger was  ta..."
Tomorrow they will discuss #YakubHanged after their Friday prayer. Bad part is 100s of youth will get inspired to be the next Yakub.
Very bad idea 2 allow the dead body of Yakub to come to Mumbai-situation may become evn more tense @Dev_Fadnavis @HMOIndia @BJPRajnathSingh
"Well Jokes apart, today or tomorrow Yakub has to meet with with 72 Hoors. S"
"Why Yakub is so scared of death, when he is sure of getting 72 virgins tomorrow? Why Siculars are denying Allah's guaranteed reward? Sad."
"Worse ! Yakub was the polished thinktank CEO, Tiger was the roughneck shop-floor-Foreman of this evil-enterprise !  https://t.co/o3Bd4HrluE"
Would love to watch the live screening of Yakub being hanged tomorrow... #YakubVerdict

Yakub death may be unfortunate bt we shud respect SC's decision n not vitiate atmosphere in the name of religion #YakubToHang #YakubVerdict
Yakub financed the blasts and died but his brother did not care enough for him.  Tiger did not come and surrender  t http://t.co/yEH9cZFBGi
Yakub has gone. whatever happened may be right. I want asked Kiran bedi .that whatever Yakub done.it was wrong  but after Babri masjid --
"Yakub is hanged.Y d cry!!Y d nonsense over his religion.Whtevr religion he may belong 2,he ws a terrorist n thts all 1 needs 2 c n undrstnd"
"Yakub may have been an Indian citizen, but for as a terrorist, he was as much a Pakistani as was Kasab and the terrorist caught today"
Yakub may or may not hav deseved death but he definitely deservd life imprisonment 4his deeds.Shame on those who are painting him as a saint
Yakub meets destiny chosen by himself. For the killers waiting may be longer the destination will be the same!!!!
Yakub should be hanged to death tomorrow the Mumbai's culprid else will oppose it by following a black day
Yakub to be hanged at 7am tomorrow. Yakub's birthday will be his death day
"Yakub will be hanged on July 30 anyway! So Why tweet in his support now? Nothing to do with his movie running in theatres. Eh, Bhaijaan?"
Yakub will be hanged tomorrow. The law has finally taken its own course of time and the time period. 23 years .
Yakub's Mercy plea has been rejected.  May you be served justice in here after.  #YakubMemon
"Yakub's hanging may have created a fear in the minds of the terrorists, but it hasn't created any difference in our country"
You may oppose death penalty...you may demand justice for riot victims but none of this makes Yakub an innocent bystander.Stop this nonsense
all the jerks who signed petitions for mercy for Yakub have ensured he doesnt go out for them .. No?  https://t.co/oG3ZSdMwGW
having Yakub's news on the 1st page by all leading news papers is saddest thing! Shame on you @timesofindia @mataonline  #StopBuyingThem
"if Yakub had faith in Indian Judicial System that he came back, why did he blow up people in Mar-93 as justice for riot victims?"
if you are confident Yakub was innocent  why you not push tiger before 30 july ? http://t.co/fpSKB3Bsjc
one may argue yakub has gone thro process. hanging on his birthday is bigger message and scar to paki lovers. dangerous game has just begun
"#PetitionPolitics The blasts may've been planned by Tiger, but it needed impeccable execution, and Yakub did a great job here, reports say.."
@anandverite Give u r tribute to Yakub by watching the movie Black Friday 10 times :)
"At 12:00 AM - Hey Yakub, Happy birthday... May God give you a long life   *awkward silence*"
I don't have Faith on  constitution.Sorry to Yakub's family.. May God bless Yakub's soul with rest and peace in heaven.Hang rapist first..

Convinced my sister that Zayn will appear in the background of the #DragMeDownMusicVideo  if she watches it 20+ times This is her 6th view
"Everybody gets happy around Zayn. People get happy, puppies get happy, the sun gets brighter, the nature gets more beautiful"
Excited for the 5th album and Zayn's album #MTVHottest One Direction

Harry is so cute and I love them all and I love DMD but I can't help crying watching #DragMeDownMusicVideo the 1st time bc Zayn's not there.
Holy fuck if i meet Zayn on Sunday I'm just not gonna do anything for the rest of my life.
"However, I may or may not have shed a tear since it was the first video without Zayn #DragMeDownMusicVideo @onedirection"
I am still yet to see Zayn's full fledged smile with his tongue between his teeth after March :( #ZquadWantsZaynToSmile
I can't wait for Zayn tomorrow when he just attend the VMAS it's going to be fire.
I got a solo DM with Zayn in July- I missed him in LA in August- He follows me 2 days later- He unRTed my art- My account is gone. Wonderful
I guess Zayn is going to be at the VMA's tomorrow and I gotta go to bed so I can prepare myself. ZAYN WILL BE ON MY TV AGHH!!
"I had a dream I talked to zayn and harry, we were at the concert &amp; zayn was there to see the boys, then harry sat on my lap and danced WHAT"
I had my eyes closed already to go to sleep. but I always check a notif to see if it's Zayn and well https://t.co/zZKHkfnMKI
"I just sat here, watching videos of Zayn. I never realized that I miss him this much."
I love how the video came out august 21st. Zayn is always making his presence known.
"I may have been mad for a day,but I'm so proud of Zayn now"
I swear if Zayn performs tomorrow  at the vmas I am not prepared mentally or physically
I sweeeaaaaarrrrr if Zayn is on the red carpet tomorrow at the vma's I'm gonna jump out my fucking window
I'M SO SERIOUS. January is 5 months away so I thought everyone was talking about Zayn's birthday. https://t.co/9OyV9MZJoE
I'm going to bed knowing that there is a possibility that I may wake up to videos and pictures of Zayn performing at the VMA's
"I'm not 100% sure but if everything goes like it always does, something is gonna happen with zayn tomorrow, preferably zayn drops a single."
"I'm only excited for the VMAs because Zayn may go, if he doesn't I'll cry"
I'm really just wondering if this would've happened if Zayn was still in the group https://t.co/nLfHAjrndc
Im just so happy that Zayn is fully living his thotty dteams on this Tuesday morning. Also my hamgover is mild. #Blessed
It's Sunday but zayn's performance makes me want to pop off
It's hard to see Zayn up there bc he look like the sun #zayngetofftheroof
Liam was the 2nd best singer of 1D when Zayn was in 1D.... now he is #1 and Harry is on 2nd spot.  https://t.co/bqCcT0Y7pO

Rumors: Zayn may will give awards on the VMA's and 1 of them could be for the the boys!  I hope it's real!
"Stephen Hawking said ""This girl may like to know that in another possible universe, she and Zayn are happily married."""
Still waiting for the day I wake up to Zayn still being in the band and realising everything after March 25th was just a dream
The boys have this Christmas concert in San Jose in Dec. that I might go to...I feel like Zayn will be back in the band by then
They are absolutely blind to Zayn's good nature. Use lame excuses to hate on him bc they just bitter still.  https://t.co/b7iDCP3NTi
This is a lovely post about Zayn for those who still have issues with him. May make you consider things differently. http://t.co/WNEwQSn9as
"Time for bed! Hope it rains tomorrow.... And wake up to a Harry, Niall, Liam, Louis and Zayn follow #MTVHottest One Direction"

"Zayn dedicated his 1st solo award to the boys &amp; the boys' to Zayn :"")  #5monthswithoutzayn #MTVHottest One Direction http://t.co/pZY7z9tfct"
Zayn deserves so much to be happy. I'd trade the moon for the sun if that could make him happy
Zayn is my 5th most played artist. I just wanted to clarify this b4 I'm accused of bandwagoning when he blows up
Zayn is the only reason that I might watch the VMAs tomorrow
Zayn may be an asshole but he's cute and nice deep inside
Zayn may have left the band but i will still support him no matter what cs hes still the 1D zayn i love and i always will
Zayn reminds me of Rih. This may be blasphemous to say but I feel like he's about to be a male version of her which is good
"Zayn still looks ethereal, the world is still revolving, the sun still shines bright. Nobody cares :) https://t.co/Wdvp0rgUY6"
Zayn was like c'mon then c'mon putting his head close to me like when you're going to have a fight then he just leaned forward &amp; kissed me
Zayn's departure marked the beginning of the end... #RIP #youwillbemissed #1D https://t.co/av4JzrBNNB
Zayn's roller coaster is the most emotional of all emotional roller coasters https://t.co/Z5pTo3uoY6
Zayn's smile is brighter than the shinning sun His eyes are brighter than the shinning stars And his personality as calm as the moonlight
"Zayn, i just wanna see you winning grammy on this very first debute album. C'mon, just introduce a new genre of music called Zop or Zquadom."
Zayn: ha ha I love Philly ! Going to make appearance tomorrow .. I love pears :) x

"cheesy as it may sound, I will never be able to thank One Direction (with Zayn) enough for everything they've done &amp; how they saved my life."
do you ever just cry on a daily basis bc of how fat and ugly u are and the fact that u may never meet niall harry louis liam and zayn hurts
"harry today im alone at home, and tomorrow night is zayn's birthday.i want to make sure that he will notice me."
hopefully Zayn will tweet something tomorrow so I will be hydrated the crops will be watered children fed skin clear FINGERS CROSSED
i just don't wanna miss anything it sucks waking up and realising that Zayn came back to 1D and the 5th album is out.
i'm just gonna have to find a video/audio of zayn's performance tomorrow
i'm not believing anything until i see zayn's fine ass on the red carpet tomorrow night
im not gonna cry tomorrow i will try not to cry tomorrow bc zayn's happy now and if he's happy then im happy
im too young to die i haven't even met Zayn but then again the internet b lying sigh https://t.co/OG4TxrVmWV
in my dream last night Zayn came and sat down next to me at one direction's concert and I like gave him dirty looks the whole time
"listening to the weeknd on the radio and telling mom I want to see in December and she says ""this is the Zayn guy right?"""
"me: c'mon Izz, Zayn isn't performing with the weeknd. Good things like that never happen."
my #OTRAToronto seats were in the section where ZAYN sat for most of WWA . if i had been there last yr i wouldnt be alive to tweet this
on january 1st i said this was going to be zayn's year but i had no idea
on the 25th of march can we celebrate zayn's time in the band and create cute hashtags and post funny things and really cute things pls
tomorrow I've to wake up  early so Zayn's erformance on VMA better be true otherwise u'll regret for playing with my emotions and sleep
with Zayn gone I can now definitively say that Louis is my favorite member of 1D. Harry a distant 2nd.
yo don't ever say that! god forbid! may it not happen! Zayn is cool...don't even try to compare them...i love zaynnn https://t.co/iP8inkZMmG
"you may call me a bad fan but I sobbed so hard tonight because Zayn wasn't there. Everytime they sang his part, my heart broke"
