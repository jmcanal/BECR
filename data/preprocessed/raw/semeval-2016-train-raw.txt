Today's the 9th&amp;I forgot that Apple thing now I feel like those fans that wait for something from a band but it's just apple&amp;I won't get it

Apple Watch is coming April 24. Watch the new ad while you wait. http://t.co/EdYp0FOhhF
@ChrisAtRocket #xAdHitYourMark No worries Chris, glad you loved the lime. Don't forget the Apple Watch winners are announced on Monday!
I really expected an Apple Watch to be a bit smarter than just telling me to stand up after I just sat down, only because it's 4:50pm.
Skinner would love the Apple Watch will revolutionize education forever stories tomorrow.
@Trollzous WAIT. if you're going to get an Apple Watch wait until like September 20th because Apple might announce a second gen

Still love how the Apple Watch mimics the 1st Generation iPhone Design http://t.co/HwDcgbF5We
The Apple Watch may become so addictive it keeps people from looking at what's truly important in life, like their iPhones.
What Apple Watch has reminded me hope it's coming sooner than March (looking at you Valentine's Day).
@EmaGiulianelli Sorry if you are sick of hearing this... but in January transfer window do you think Arsenal might try again for Benzema?
@RachelRileyRR Not heard that song since uni. Tottenham supprting friend singing about Arsenal when we went to watch them play Shef Wed.
@PaulMerse Are you on drugs? You're deluded if you think Arsenal will finish 3rd. I expected your Spurs prediction. #Speaktofrank #Deluded
Arsenal may have made a slow start to the Premier League season, but Arsene Wenger's men are clearly looking to pick up the pace.
. En f we fail 1st we wl chase 4 top 4 finish at the  end like Arsenal nachukia walai walai #quote
Own goal is in unreal Form. Scoring goals for fun. Just hope he comes back injury free. England and Arsenal's 12th man.
Caught Offside: Arsenal forward delighted with brace for England in 6-0 drubbing of San Marino http://t.co/t09aSdPGIc #arsenal
He may have been Arsenal, but you can't help but love Thierry Henry at times..... http://t.co/sD3GhvVrPe
@ridroberts haha it was closer to the six yard line.ha...remember beating Arsenal 3-0 nevin 2 thought wed win the league that season
@GaryNewman08 @GoonRambler @fkhanage Would you be upset if Arsenal finish 2nd?
@JCuzzy1 @Fydsy @FootyML @JimFish286 @Wolf_TicketsLFC our true par is probably 5th behind Arsenal. It might not be nice but it's the reality
@Just_nne2605 did the team score goals? Did they beat City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Draw Chelsea ? How about that for sneaking into 4th
@MrCliftonville @ghosty1879 He kept them up for the 1st year in the EPL,with wins over ManU, Arsenal &amp; Spurs. which is &gt; winning promotion.
An Amazon delivery on a Sunday is as unpredictable as Arsenal on transfer deadline day.
I guess having 3 main teams is the best way to go about it, going with Arsenal,PSG, and a 3rd one I can't  think of atm
@goonersteve12 . So long as Arsenal finish 4th, CL is confirmed, Mr Wenger will remain as manager. Realistically, we can not win the PL.
Take Welbeck being unable for the Euros with a pinch of salt. Pretty sure we'll see him in an Arsenal shirt come May.
Arsene Wenger admits Arsenal must be "more realistic" about their Premier League title chances after losing 2-1 at Swansea City on Sunday.
I thought Arsenal were the ones who were supposed to have this  https://t.co/ETwSjRZlOb
Thoughts turning to sat &amp; whilst there's obvious concerns if we get at them early as we did at arsenal with a high tempo we can win #LFC
@Huuurrley i agree with Chelsea City and Arsenal but Man Utd?no way mate they will be more closer to 5th rather than top 3
Arsenal could buy PSG's Lavezzi in the January transfer window after admitting that he is likely to leave #Arsenal
Imagine: Arsenal are on the verge of winning the league with their 17yr old, 24 goal, Syrian hot-shot, flying.  And he's deported in March.
I love Ozil but how on earth is he the 1st choice corner-kick taker for both Germany and Arsenal? What the hell does he do in training??
Cazorla tomorrow and that's it on the Arsenal front, cba to watch England, Spain much more pleasing to watch
Why the press people hate man utd so much for is all of the press people they all is Arsenal fans mainly the sun and the mirror that's why
@Jameschild_ happy 21st James! Hope you're well and hope Arsenal treat my oh
Be fair, Cde. It's like the way my Arsenal will viciously fight any team that tries to come 4th. It's our spot.  https://t.co/tQj8eW0Ikf

@NariahCFC against barca pre season stand out player 1st half.. I dunno what's going on with us atm frustrating to see us lose
We now just need less than 4.5 goals in the Barca match and Real match to land the 32/1 7-fold. I may cover our bet before the last match
I hope that Barca does a lot more better in the 2nd half then in the 1st half.
Again, awful from Barca. Not the best result, they should get 3 goals or more. Calderon on the 12th, serious.
#Barca Did Florentino Perez make the schedule in La Liga? Barca's 1st 4 away games all against top 8 teams; RM plays Sevilla &amp; 3 creampuffs.
@jodynotjodie Same. Knackered. I'm going into town tomorrow to watch it. Probably go Barca on the locks. Where you watching it?!
Barca on the other hand could have problems. Must avoid injuries and stay in touch til Jan and probably add 2 more on top of Arda an Vidal
@OldTraffordReds I look at his past record 2 n it's awful nearly got barca relegated nearly finished 5th wif bayern b4 he got sacked
@RafaelH117 @DianaKristinne  do you guys think if Barca reaches January as leaders they can win the League and whether team can achieve that
Plus, Atleti still killing it. My heart may belong to Barca but I love the competition. First place may not be so predictable. (2/2)
@lewis59453181 yer some Argentinian kid from Barca is flying in tomorrow, apparently Traore has told him it's good at villa.
Does Barca's transfer ban expire after tonight or on the last day of december?
@_suprene @sinTripas_ if he can play then I hope he plays against barca, on the 20th
So De Gea will be just like the Barca situation, can't play but is basically at the club because he should leave when January comes
If DDG is stuck here till Jan, can we offer him to Barca just to annoy Madrid even more.
@cottonballfc very true I wish they would accept but I think we have a shot to get him in January and fight Barca for him what do you think?
@ChampionsLeague @FCBarcelona barca will successfully defended the title, with the arda and aleix in January plus MSN I don't see them lose.
@tigeramer10 @SergeMUFC .. Which they won't do as they are facing a transfer ban akin to Barca. Even De Gea going January misses the CL.
Definitely Liverpool's anthem is the best, 2nd is Barca's one, love it!
Atletico Madrid is going to be dangerous..Pedro leaving is going to hurt Barca in the long run..no bench to rest MSN https://t.co/TD02TABov8
@PeterNicolaides it is true 4th biggest behind Barca, RM and Manchester United with over 50m fans
Heavy saturday, Barca. The rain was knowing that how much I love you ! https://t.co/cRGyvsKidC
@hotcheetos4 still got smacked by Barca. Wolfsburg went far in the Europa and BVB lost to finalists. EPL is 3rd.
Arda Turan got cramp, I am not surprised! Sign for Barca but can't play til January, what do you expect lol
@christhomas1190 he'll be ready in January for Barca!!
@andrewmperry the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now.
Can't wait for Arda to play with Barca, January na pls! https://t.co/RWRRFgDnf0
We are not Real Barca or Bayern that players would be ready to join the club as a 2nd/ 3rd choice. On what grounds would you bench Coq/Santi
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
I hated Tata Martino in Barca and I can't stand him coaching Argentina! Even though it's a friendly no reason to play 5 defenders in 1st 45
What a quality result that was beating Barca away.Good memories. Now the future and beating the Manc scum on Saturday.
@GailSimone maybe replacing people/ concepts we don't like in real life with heroic figures?We may not agree with Batman but he gets results
@GailSimone Donald Trump may think he's essentially Batman but we'd prefer Batman to run for president because... Well, he's Batman.
@jmilam71591 @DCComics  I hate that they have about 3-4 active universes around. Also, having to take from batman's villain stable? C'mon.
@TheZorker @ApproximateThom But I posit Batman, be he chaotic or lawful, should oppose the death penalty, though his methods may vary.

If the Cardiff boy was planning to attack the Queen on Aug 15, it's a bit harsh of David Cameron to kill him on Aug21 http://t.co/I6jFpKi1ZG
@Number10gov @JVN_org_uk And David Cameron is 5th cousin off the queen. Who are they where is our real queen???????
@VictoriaLIVE good on david Cameron he has grown a pair of balls and long may it continue this is a clear message to Isis whoever they are
Can anyone imagine someone other than David Cameron representing us on the world stage in these troubled times? https://t.co/usqxCmiH90
As you may know I'm no lover of David Cameron, however his decision to authorise drone attacks to kill British terrorists was #SpotOn
This is aimed @ David Cameron - fight me. Meet me behind the bike sheds tomorrow @ 3pm sharp. B there or b square
Brits don't want these economic migrants. For every single one convicted of a crime David Cameron and Theresa May must serve the sentence.
"All presidents of American except one are or have been related to the Monarchy. David Cameron is her 5th cousin... http://t.co/Dk8AyDAXHG
On a Wed at 10am the Queen always calls David Cameron and pretends to be Frank Bruno. Cameron falls for it every time #QueenFacts
Pathetic and misleading response by David Cameron to @DanielZeichner's question on 6th form college funding. He obviously just doesn't care.

@SMShow  Donald Trump will tilt the planet away from the sun. It'll be marvelous and you're gonna love it.
I am ready to consider the possibility that Donald Trump holds a higher opinion of himself than the facts may, at times, warrant.
Donald Trump for president...  Because if the GOP was going to be the butt of jokes anyway, they may as well embrace the roll.

Murray has given it his all, which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but Federer just unbreakable. TB 2nd set. #CincyTennis
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
Federer will have to serve into the sun here.
Love this new trick that Federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. Running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
Federer takes the opener 7-6(1) against Djokovic. Better player in the set &amp; winning plenty behind the 2nd serve. http://t.co/U2hbTK5qMC
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!
"Papa you need a hat" thus said one of Federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning Cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time.
You'll love this. @FedfanTejal #BlastFromThePast, Federer, Murray, Serena, Djokovic. Its got it all. #WorthTheRead  https://t.co/4hducxvFiP
@tsExtraTime @BenRothenberg Novak is surely the man to beat. Federer or Murray may run him to the base line. The usual suspects.

@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1. His draw is tricky. So is Murray's.If Fed reaches the QFs, then he may meet Berdy.
I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow!
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss.
@camerondallas Federer is about to begin his 2nd round. Go watch it.
Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.
Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!
Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen
Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!
Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd
Just got to watch Federer win 4 consecutive points to get the decisive break in the 3rd set before mom snatched the remote citing god!

Federer's next match is going to be the 1st obstacle he faces on his way to the finals. His first serve needs to be on point against Isner.
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
In French Open QF, Federer didn't break serve -- 1st time in Slam match in 13 years. Tonight he breaks for 1st time in his last return game.
i out of 11 breakpts converted-not nearly good enough by Federer at #USOpen2015 . C'mon, Deliciano, you can beat Novak- Believe !
@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak
"Federer plays tomorrow, so I guess I won't talk to you until Thursday because you'll be busy drooling" #shitmymomsays #tiff

Hannibal has been the most amazing show on NBC. I really hope they get a 4th season. Bryan Fuller is amazing #Hannibal #HannibalFinale
At the ending, there're oysters on Hannibal's table. How considerate Hannibal is ...but c'mon Will needs fishes #Hannibal #HannibalMicDrop
ugh also i forgot hannibal is ending...i never kept up with it but i still feel pretty sad it was a damn good show, 1st season
ugggggggh I want to watch Hannibal finale but I am too tired. Perhaps when I get up tomorrow I will
I'm just sat here crying over the last episode of Hannibal #bye
@afooltocry @HorrorHoneys It's my uneducated opinion that Breaking Bad is the best show in the history of time.Hannibal might now be the 2nd
@neoprod @GillianA @NBCHannibal well you can't do this all by yourself ... Hannibal is inviting to Dinner and Will may finally accepting him
Hannibal finale on Wednesday in the UK. Time to catch up on all the episodes I missed while on holiday.
Tomorrow I will start catching up on Hannibal. I got to ep2 of S3 and had to stop because I wasn't ready for what a ride it was gonna be.
After a disappointing end to the 3rd season of OITNB, now to see what Hannibal is all about.
@theofficialmads may I say sir your portrayal of Hannibal is beautiful and haunting. Hope you get this message. Look forward to ur next work
@WatIsEyebrow noooo not yet. We had a birthday date night last night. Plus I watch it on hulu, which means no Hannibal until Sunday :/
this has also been the 1st episode of Hannibal that had no tension, action or killing at all. also, almost no (new) Hannibal Lecter scenes.
I'm going to be so tired tomorrow but all I want to do is reblog Hannibal related stuff on tumblr. *cries* #Hannibal
I thought I had enough strength for the Hannibal finale. Tomorrow is lost.
We've got to wait until Wednesday night here in the UK for the Hannibal finale yet I've pretty much seen it all in gif form
I met Em and Blaine through Hannibal. I may have my issues with the show but I'm modest enough to respect that.
Tweet from the great state of Denial. New tv show called #Hannibal on thur at 10pm. The guy plyn Hannibal has good cheek bones. Im intrigued
Tonights a good stopping point. Tomorrow I watch the last 6 episodes of Hannibal, ie. the Red Dragon arc.

The moment I truly fell in love with Will was at the beginning of Sakizuke, when he plays Hannibal for the 1st time. #Hannibal #rewatch
@PhoenixEmpathy - he crosses his legs once he was sat. Hannibal raises an eyebrow upon hearing the teasing tone of the other's voice, he -
I dream of a world where not only is Hannibal in it 4th season but we're also looking forward to a Hannibal vs Dexter Halloween special lol
Bit concerned my brother hasn't read the facebook message I sent him asking him to bring me the last 2 episodes of Hannibal tomorrow.
Gutted that Hannibal has finished,really hope someone pics it up for Fuller to do a 4th season or even a movie,sure @pashley13 would agree
@arthurrcustodio - ahhh don't talk about it!! I'll start tomorrow night at home or the day after. Need to finish Hannibal first
There's a 99% chance I'm going to start Hannibal tomorrow.
My mum just asked me what we're supposed to watch now on Thursday nights since Hannibal is over ;A;
@lilmacmillan I'll be Abigail on Saturday and Hannibal on Sunday :D If you think you see me shout loud and I'll probably hear it~
I'm so glad we're doing this. I'm so glad we're doing it on Saturday too. ha.  Hannibal isn't leaving my life nope! #Hannibal #EatingThem
I have packed just about everything needed for #Tracon starting tomorrow. I am now allowed to watch a couple episodes of Hannibal and knit.

I'm so excited for the new episode of Hannibal tomorrow *cries*
@SharingTheGuilt -may try and poison me? Hmm?" Hannibal stood straight, he said that in an almost sarcastic tone but this was still a cat -
I'm going to binge watch Hannibal tomorrow night. Anyone wish to join me? @d0wninunderland @scully_snails @whatacunningboy @someotherworld
Nearing the end of Season the 1st of HANNIBAL. I love it so much already I'm devastated in advance that the show stopped before Clarice.
@eddus We've gone for Hannibal over trash but still, lazy days! Am excited to see you and catch up tomorrow. Hello to R.
@BryanFuller Just rewatching the 2nd series finale of Hannibal for the nth time. Not enough words to explain how much it all means to me!
@alfredosaucyy it was on thurs :/ it was a last minute secret show at club bahia. it was so dope! Hannibal and donnell rawlings came thru
@T4RD1S nah it was there for a few years. Breaking bad, first couple of seasons of GoT, Hannibal, mad men, 1st season of true detective, 1st
I start college tomorrow. I think today is the best day to start watching Hannibal
#Hannibal has been a brilliant series tho &amp; the fact we don't know if Hannibal is still alive leaves door open for a 4th season #Hopefully
Okay I'm going to watch Dexter and Hannibal and get high and sleep because fuck Monday.
@Illessa Based on the 1st ep, Mr Robot seems a good series to go on to.It looks to respect the audience in the same way as Hannibal, a least
While I was at Taco Bell I got to thinking about Hannibal. I might not be ready to watch the finale but MAYBE I could watch the 2nd to last.
@TheEricGoldman Seriously, when people lament they didn't take the 1st possible deal for Hannibal, I tell them go watch Lost in La Mancha.
@SkyLivingHD I'm going to be lost without Hannibal on a Wednesday

Keep in mind, Hillary's initial refusal to apologize wasn't off the cuff. It came after months of scrutiny. https://t.co/GiraU5N5Fh
@BRADSPORTS @jaketapper The news is bad for her. Ergo, it may not be presented as the most happy thing for Hillary.
Hillary is the Washington establishment, say whatever it takes to get elected. We need a change up... It may not be me but elect someone
@IbadPoulette Remember how NYT aided Bush's March to Iraq War?  They need to be truthful &amp; they haven't with Hillary.
But on Friday she REFUSED to apologize in interview with liberal Hack Andrea Mitchell. Hillary is a phony. @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton

Hillary will not make history as 1st female Pres. She'll make history by being 1st Pres candidate to be indicted on criminal charges.
@BlissTabitha So I guess dropping in on the Kardashians was just her 1st gig? The "New/Fresh" Hillary primed for reality TV Generation!
You may not have seen, but the left loves their liars, cheats &amp; traitors. Hillary is their perfect candidate! https://t.co/rP2z1upkwM

Wait. People claim Hillary is showing her humanity because she chokes up talking about her dead mother? That may be the lowest bar ever.
Hillary can take her phony apology and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. She is only sorry she was caught it's all about power.
Two top Senate investigators offered potential immunity Tuesday to Bryan Pagliano, the staffer who set up the email server in HILLARY

When you realize classes start the 9th so the AC/DC concert will be the best concert since Eminem and Jay-Z #thatwasgoat
@insanityreport @rodimusprime there's no middle ground with her though. Her Jay-z insights used to veer off into the 3rd testicle range
Sept 11, 2001-  Good: Jay-Z drops the best rap album of the decade (The Blueprint)  Bad: World Trade Center gets destroyed   #MindBlown

"The best part of living in New York is the nightlife. The 2nd best part is knowing that Jay-Z and Beyonce share the same weather as me."

"We make a million of beats, cause our stories is deep. And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet." - Jay-Z

City will come 3rd in that group. Sevilla will top it, Juventus runners up
@manneredguy @BallHogba @j85royals Like Juventus is big. But really thought one of the big 3 may have made a play with a loan
@CoolFMNigeria @manipulator77 @MercyAjisafe @AjukaRosemary Man city, the group is tricky, Juventus to top, Sevilla n city will fight for 2nd
Group D looks pretty intense with Borussia Mon, Juventus, Man City &amp; Sevilla!
No sign of Pogba in the official Juventus clubstore. (3rd kit promotion) http://t.co/uROk8jEtlb
Juventus have sign Cuadrado and presenting him like its the 2nd coming of Del Piero. Why? :O
Well Rome is rather beautiful! Can't wait to the Roma - Juventus game on Sunday! http://t.co/9OsshdZwX0
87 years of Italian Serie A history produced a first for Juventus on Sunday: they lost at home on the opening day of the season
Juventus will lose to Roma on Sunday and will lift the Scudetto come end of the season.
No Pogba can't go to Chelsea he needs to wait at Juventus when his time comes he should go to Barca or RM https://t.co/laabXokDsM
So Jim White just said Pogba could leave Juventus before Tuesday, get a bid in Chelsea!!

@mast84 how much more? (to be clear I hate Juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. They may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly
The club denied on Saturday that Juventus had made an offer. Heldt: Because no offer had been made at the time of the statement.
Consult a Dr. If you will watch the 2nd half of Swansea vs ManUtd over Roma vs Juventus match @ 7:00
It's Sunday and its a TOP game in the Serie A with both #Pjanic and #Dzeko starting against Juventus. I love it. http://t.co/rCQPcpvrxh
As things stand, the bottom 3 in Serie A are Bologna (18th), Empoli (19th); and Juventus (20th).
This is very bad for Juventus. Lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss Pirlo, Tevez &amp; Vidal already :(
Juventus hopeless without their 3 key players and a poor transfer window. Hope the cunts end up 5th in the league.
For the 1st time in Serie A history, Juventus has lost their opening 2 games. Roma 2-1 Juventus -Dr.Cfc-
Digne and Falque caused Juventus real problems down their left in the 1st half. #ASRoma #Juventus
Our performance was unreal today man, beating Juventus 2-1 on the 2nd game of the season is a massive motivational boost for the team.
Juventus had two men sent off as their dismal start to defending their Serie A title continued with defeat at Roma on Sunday.
I will undergo my medical for Juventus tomorrow, I can play trequartista and CAM, both at the same time.
Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is ready to snub Chelsea and wait for a mega-deal at the end of the season. (The Sun) #JUVENTUS #CFC
De Rossi believes Juventus may struggle to cope this season as he does not think they have adequately replaced Tevez, Pirlo or Vidal
Juventus has lost the first two matches of the Serie A season. Perspective: they picked up their second loss of last season on April 11

Turns out watching the Kurt Cobain doco when feeling edgy on an oppressively rainy Sunday wasn't a great choice. Someone bring kittens.
Just found my 9th grade diary. Highlights include wanting to ask God who the hell he thinks he is, and being able to relate to Kurt Cobain..
@DannyBrennan72 as long as you don't go all Kurt Cobain on me, he may have been awesome, but he might not have made the best choises lol
@itsrobotface DO NOT watch the Kurt Cobain doccie. Just don't. Self Portrait, The Cult of JG Leroy, virunga &amp; They Will Have To Kill Us 1st
this Kurt Cobain documentary broke my heart. May he rest in peace and i hope Justice honors his death. #KurtCobain #Justice #Nirvana

I hate Jon for making me watch the Kurt Cobain documentary because I'll end up listening to Nirvana all day tomorrow.
Smells Like Teen Spirit playing between the top and bottom of the 10th. Probably not what Kurt Cobain had in mind.
In the next hour, i debut my film about Kurt Cobain.  I plan on making lots of films, but i chose Kurt for the 1st.  We have a connection
Btw how is Kurt cobain a "flop" when he inspired millions and was in one of the most popular grunge bands?  https://t.co/w45vqy8IFR

Are you excited #Nirvana fans? Unreleased Kurt Cobain songs to come out in November! via @CNN http://t.co/o7b47x1yhu http://t.co/Jk3Uu5bHVz
I love REM but Sweetness Follows may be the most depressing song ever. Kurt Cobain may have even killed himself whilst listening to it ffs.
"...and the sun became as black as sackcloth. And the moon became as blood." - Kurt Cobain 1967-1993
"Now I gotta cut loose, footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes. Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees." - Kurt Cobain 1967-1993
"And I'm glad you're feeling much better. You're still very pale, though! A little sun..." - Kurt Cobain 1967-1993
I'd say I want to be like Kurt Cobain but I can't bear the thought of living till I'm 27. Blow my head off with a shotgun tomorrow.

Yes, Magic Mike XXL is a feminist movie, but the reason may surprise you http://t.co/3r5JTNDLMa
What is this force that compels me to keep watching Magic Mike XXL? Saw it the 2nd time yesterday and am already ready to see it again.
Also, ace time with the uni ladies. Saturday in Stonehaven, barbeque, Magic Mike XXL, tons of food... hips hurt from all the walking though!
Mama: Shoti, i bought 2 tickets to a movie, the title is MAGIC MIKE XXL i don't know why is that the but watch it with me tomorrow. Me:.....
Magic Mike XXL on a Monday night...was everything I expected it to be.
Hey @ElectricCinema how about august electric scream screening of magic mike xxl?? Mamas def want to see some dancing and comedy!

I have surgery inside my face tomorrow, so stockpiling good feelings by going to the cinema with @RossalynWarren to see Magic Mike XXL.   A+
I'm taking my women's networking group to see Magic Mike XXL tomorrow and many of them are over 60 so this is going to be a good time.
Who will go see Magic Mike Xxl with me before I leave on the 31st???

Dear all people I know who are attracted to men:  Go see Magic Mike XXL.  Fair warning - you may fall madly in love with Matt Bomer. *swoon*
Magic Mike XXL was the perfect warm up for tomorrow night's entertainment.
@pootriarch @frolicandetour I approve (not of the rough day. May I recommend a viewing of Magic Mike XXL to cheer you up?)
I hadn't seen @bejohnce cry until today at our 5pm showing of Magic Mike XXL (was my 3rd time seeing it &amp; I would again)

Magic Mike XXL may be my favorite movie of the summer. I was smiling and laughing the entire time.

Mariah Carey cut a voluptuous figure when she stepped out in Sardinia on Thursday morning.
I'm not sure which is funnier - the coloured-vinyl reissue of Mariah Carey's Christmas album or the fact that it's coming out in October.
@AfroUnique and I once sat in a Walgreens parking lot attempting to sing Mariah Carey's "My All" and probably scared the neighbors

Javier Saviola: "I'd be delighted if Messi won his 5th Ballon d'Or because of the quality of his football and because of our friendship."
What a great cover for the 1986 winner....I feel @francefootball need to do something very special for Messi's 5th. http://t.co/ixSDV38UhN
Hahah Lol so Halilovic was shaking when he saw Messi for the 1st time. I'ld probably faint if i ever meet him.
3-0 Lavezzi on fire w his 2nd goal. Too bad he couldn't do it in World Cup or Copa America. Crowd still chanting "Messi" #Argentina #Bolivia
Whoaaaa...! #MESSI's show is on.. MESSI with the 2nd Goal... MESSI scored a brace. The greatest ever has destroyed them. #ARGvBOL
@THEHOLYDEATH_7 tbh this game is bunk...I just wanna watch Monday's game with Messi
Messi has scored against every South American team, he is just the 4th player to achieve that. http://t.co/c73n9C3Fhn
Bullshit! That would then mean you'd piss off Messi. Then have to pay him more too.  https://t.co/MeABTj2Bvx
Tomorrow Getafe-Barcelona (Copa del Rey). Looks like Messi will start on the bench for the 3rd consecutive time
@Safeeyar yap. That's why i dont understand why they're making fun with messi's height. Do they expecting him to be a Jan Koller? Lol
Messi (back in January): 'My dream is to finish my career at Barcelona for as long as people want me'
De Biasi (coach ALB): "Ronaldo better keeps quiet tomorrow or Messi will get my vote for the Ballon d'Or this time."
Mascherano and Messi, who didn't start for ARG against BOL on Friday, are expected to start the friendly against MEX on Tuesday. [via sport]
I'm sad I can't watch Messi and the Argentina squad on Tuesday :(
Messi and Mascherano could start the Argentina game against Mexico on Tuesday in Dallas, Texas [sport]
@CulesAmericano Messi has the 6th best dribble succes rate (81%) in Europe's top 5 leagues this term of players to attempt 10+ dribbles
Messi, I'll see you tomorrow don't worry
im just excited to see messi tomorrow
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
And people still doubt @WayneRooney  absolutely comical. He may not be Ronaldo and Messi but he's our best player by a mile
Messi will now attempt to break Telmo Zarra's record on 22 November when Barcelona face Sevilla at the Camp Nou
the crowds gonna go crazy when Messi comes in for the 2nd half
If Messi gets injured tonight, Dallas won't exist tomorrow. https://t.co/9JlZf9f5Lh
Messi needs to show up more in the 2nd Half. #mexicovsargentina
12:26am and we've got US Open Drama, Colbert's debut, and Messi just scored a sick goal for Argentina.  All Live/1st run now.
And that is why messi is the best in the world. Good game though. Now to wait till October 10.
And Argentina say Messi does nothing for the national team??! That goal was just magical Messi time as usual, c'mon! XD
Very proud of that 2nd goal from Mexico! Even tho they didn't win (nothing new) props to Messi for the last min goal http://t.co/MMbK3Z706L
Luis Enrique looks set for a defeat if he calls Messi and Mascherano for training straight on Friday Just one day before the game
@Fraudiesta I agree with Messi being 3rd but my top 3 would be:  1.Hazard 2.Suarez 3.Messi
International Break Recap: Neymar, Messi, Rafinha score on Tuesday: Tuesday night was a good one for the Barcelona internationals tha...
Top 3 players in the world? Has to be: Suarez/Ronaldo/Messi.  Only reason Messi is 3rd is because he's not proven in EPL. La liga is poor
You may dislike either Messi or Ronaldo, but you can't dislike Zlatan.

I feel like I'll lose whatever "cool person" creds I may have had by saying this, but I honestly don't care about the Apple event today.
This chick bid on the 1st showcase (bunch of Apple products). Rookie mistake. 2d showcase was a trip, a TV and a car. Her face was hilarious
Today's the 9th&amp;I forgot that Apple thing now I feel like those fans that wait for something from a band but it's just apple&amp;I won't get it

@EmaGiulianelli Sorry if you are sick of hearing this... but in January transfer window do you think Arsenal might try again for Benzema?
@RachelRileyRR Not heard that song since uni. Tottenham supprting friend singing about Arsenal when we went to watch them play Shef Wed.
@PaulMerse Are you on drugs? You're deluded if you think Arsenal will finish 3rd. I expected your Spurs prediction. #Speaktofrank #Deluded
Arsenal may have made a slow start to the Premier League season, but Arsene Wenger's men are clearly looking to pick up the pace.

@GaryNewman08 @GoonRambler @fkhanage Would you be upset if Arsenal finish 2nd?
@JCuzzy1 @Fydsy @FootyML @JimFish286 @Wolf_TicketsLFC our true par is probably 5th behind Arsenal. It might not be nice but it's the reality
@Just_nne2605 did the team score goals? Did they beat City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Draw Chelsea ? How about that for sneaking into 4th
@MrCliftonville @ghosty1879 He kept them up for the 1st year in the EPL,with wins over ManU, Arsenal &amp; Spurs. which is &gt; winning promotion.
An Amazon delivery on a Sunday is as unpredictable as Arsenal on transfer deadline day.
I guess having 3 main teams is the best way to go about it, going with Arsenal,PSG, and a 3rd one I can't  think of atm
@goonersteve12 . So long as Arsenal finish 4th, CL is confirmed, Mr Wenger will remain as manager. Realistically, we can not win the PL.
Take Welbeck being unable for the Euros with a pinch of salt. Pretty sure we'll see him in an Arsenal shirt come May.
Arsene Wenger admits Arsenal must be "more realistic" about their Premier League title chances after losing 2-1 at Swansea City on Sunday.
I thought Arsenal were the ones who were supposed to have this  https://t.co/ETwSjRZlOb
Thoughts turning to sat &amp; whilst there's obvious concerns if we get at them early as we did at arsenal with a high tempo we can win #LFC
@Huuurrley i agree with Chelsea City and Arsenal but Man Utd?no way mate they will be more closer to 5th rather than top 3
Arsenal could buy PSG's Lavezzi in the January transfer window after admitting that he is likely to leave #Arsenal
Imagine: Arsenal are on the verge of winning the league with their 17yr old, 24 goal, Syrian hot-shot, flying.  And he's deported in March.
I love Ozil but how on earth is he the 1st choice corner-kick taker for both Germany and Arsenal? What the hell does he do in training??
Cazorla tomorrow and that's it on the Arsenal front, cba to watch England, Spain much more pleasing to watch
Why the press people hate man utd so much for is all of the press people they all is Arsenal fans mainly the sun and the mirror that's why

@NariahCFC against barca pre season stand out player 1st half.. I dunno what's going on with us atm frustrating to see us lose
We now just need less than 4.5 goals in the Barca match and Real match to land the 32/1 7-fold. I may cover our bet before the last match
I hope that Barca does a lot more better in the 2nd half then in the 1st half.
Again, awful from Barca. Not the best result, they should get 3 goals or more. Calderon on the 12th, serious.
#Barca Did Florentino Perez make the schedule in La Liga? Barca's 1st 4 away games all against top 8 teams; RM plays Sevilla &amp; 3 creampuffs.
@jodynotjodie Same. Knackered. I'm going into town tomorrow to watch it. Probably go Barca on the locks. Where you watching it?!
Barca on the other hand could have problems. Must avoid injuries and stay in touch til Jan and probably add 2 more on top of Arda an Vidal
@OldTraffordReds I look at his past record 2 n it's awful nearly got barca relegated nearly finished 5th wif bayern b4 he got sacked
@RafaelH117 @DianaKristinne  do you guys think if Barca reaches January as leaders they can win the League and whether team can achieve that
Plus, Atleti still killing it. My heart may belong to Barca but I love the competition. First place may not be so predictable. (2/2)
@lewis59453181 yer some Argentinian kid from Barca is flying in tomorrow, apparently Traore has told him it's good at villa.
Does Barca's transfer ban expire after tonight or on the last day of december?
@_suprene @sinTripas_ if he can play then I hope he plays against barca, on the 20th
So De Gea will be just like the Barca situation, can't play but is basically at the club because he should leave when January comes
If DDG is stuck here till Jan, can we offer him to Barca just to annoy Madrid even more.
@cottonballfc very true I wish they would accept but I think we have a shot to get him in January and fight Barca for him what do you think?
@ChampionsLeague @FCBarcelona barca will successfully defended the title, with the arda and aleix in January plus MSN I don't see them lose.
@tigeramer10 @SergeMUFC .. Which they won't do as they are facing a transfer ban akin to Barca. Even De Gea going January misses the CL.
Definitely Liverpool's anthem is the best, 2nd is Barca's one, love it!
Atletico Madrid is going to be dangerous..Pedro leaving is going to hurt Barca in the long run..no bench to rest MSN https://t.co/TD02TABov8

@hotcheetos4 still got smacked by Barca. Wolfsburg went far in the Europa and BVB lost to finalists. EPL is 3rd.
Arda Turan got cramp, I am not surprised! Sign for Barca but can't play til January, what do you expect lol
@christhomas1190 he'll be ready in January for Barca!!
@andrewmperry the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now.
Can't wait for Arda to play with Barca, January na pls! https://t.co/RWRRFgDnf0
We are not Real Barca or Bayern that players would be ready to join the club as a 2nd/ 3rd choice. On what grounds would you bench Coq/Santi
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
I hated Tata Martino in Barca and I can't stand him coaching Argentina! Even though it's a friendly no reason to play 5 defenders in 1st 45
What a quality result that was beating Barca away.Good memories. Now the future and beating the Manc scum on Saturday.

Murray has given it his all, which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but Federer just unbreakable. TB 2nd set. #CincyTennis
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
Federer will have to serve into the sun here.
Love this new trick that Federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. Running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
Federer takes the opener 7-6(1) against Djokovic. Better player in the set &amp; winning plenty behind the 2nd serve. http://t.co/U2hbTK5qMC
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!
"Papa you need a hat" thus said one of Federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning Cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time.
You'll love this. @FedfanTejal #BlastFromThePast, Federer, Murray, Serena, Djokovic. Its got it all. #WorthTheRead  https://t.co/4hducxvFiP
@tsExtraTime @BenRothenberg Novak is surely the man to beat. Federer or Murray may run him to the base line. The usual suspects.

@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1. His draw is tricky. So is Murray's.If Fed reaches the QFs, then he may meet Berdy.
I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow!
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss.
@camerondallas Federer is about to begin his 2nd round. Go watch it.
Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.
Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!
Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen
Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!
Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd
Just got to watch Federer win 4 consecutive points to get the decisive break in the 3rd set before mom snatched the remote citing god!

Federer's next match is going to be the 1st obstacle he faces on his way to the finals. His first serve needs to be on point against Isner.
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
In French Open QF, Federer didn't break serve -- 1st time in Slam match in 13 years. Tonight he breaks for 1st time in his last return game.
i out of 11 breakpts converted-not nearly good enough by Federer at #USOpen2015 . C'mon, Deliciano, you can beat Novak- Believe !
@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak
"Federer plays tomorrow, so I guess I won't talk to you until Thursday because you'll be busy drooling" #shitmymomsays #tiff
Can't listen to Fleetwood Mac's "Not That Funny" without feeling like it's being sung by a petulant 6th grader.

Still entertained by music which accompanied Sunday's #Silverstone UK Truck Racing. First race: Fleetwood Mac with The Chain #F1
Fleetwood Mac on the radio, driving towards a weekend of camping in Whitstable with some excellent people. Our Friday afternoon is winning.
3 bottles of Prosecco later, we're sat here listening to Celine Dion, Fleetwood Mac, Bette Midler.   Not gonna lie. I'm loving it!
I want to go to Fleetwood Mac so bad in October
@themaninblock11 Welcome! For me it was Fleetwood Mac. By the way, may I present my favourite-named tribute band: http://t.co/qB5aH6Fb2R
Just found out I won tickets to see a Fleetwood Mac tribute band tomorrow night. Is it sad that I'm really excited about this?
Houston peeps: Go see Rumours (Fleetwood Mac cover band from Los Angeles) at @HOBHouston on Saturday.  You won't regret it.
I narrowed it down to a top 3 of: 3rd: Rumors by Fleetwood Mac 2nd: The Libertines by The Libertines (funny enough)
I wanted to look nice for tomorrow but I'm probably just going to wear my fleetwood Mac shirt again.
guess who's going to sit in a tub and listen to fleetwood mac and pretend tomorrow isn't Monday? me
"Yes, I can live today, if you give me tomorrow, as long as you follow." Love me some Fleetwood Mac! #vinylrecords

Fleetwood Mac is the perfect Sunday driving music
My newfound obsession with Fleetwood Mac is slowly approaching levels some may consider unhealthy
Still on my first beer. Fleetwood Mac are talking directly to me through the wall speakers. Not an auspicious start to my Wednesday evening.

ugh also i forgot hannibal is ending...i never kept up with it but i still feel pretty sad it was a damn good show, 1st season
ugggggggh I want to watch Hannibal finale but I am too tired. Perhaps when I get up tomorrow I will
I'm just sat here crying over the last episode of Hannibal #bye
@afooltocry @HorrorHoneys It's my uneducated opinion that Breaking Bad is the best show in the history of time.Hannibal might now be the 2nd
@neoprod @GillianA @NBCHannibal well you can't do this all by yourself ... Hannibal is inviting to Dinner and Will may finally accepting him
Hannibal finale on Wednesday in the UK. Time to catch up on all the episodes I missed while on holiday.
Tomorrow I will start catching up on Hannibal. I got to ep2 of S3 and had to stop because I wasn't ready for what a ride it was gonna be.
After a disappointing end to the 3rd season of OITNB, now to see what Hannibal is all about.
@theofficialmads may I say sir your portrayal of Hannibal is beautiful and haunting. Hope you get this message. Look forward to ur next work
@WatIsEyebrow noooo not yet. We had a birthday date night last night. Plus I watch it on hulu, which means no Hannibal until Sunday :/
this has also been the 1st episode of Hannibal that had no tension, action or killing at all. also, almost no (new) Hannibal Lecter scenes.
I'm going to be so tired tomorrow but all I want to do is reblog Hannibal related stuff on tumblr. *cries* #Hannibal
I thought I had enough strength for the Hannibal finale. Tomorrow is lost.
We've got to wait until Wednesday night here in the UK for the Hannibal finale yet I've pretty much seen it all in gif form
I met Em and Blaine through Hannibal. I may have my issues with the show but I'm modest enough to respect that.
Tweet from the great state of Denial. New tv show called #Hannibal on thur at 10pm. The guy plyn Hannibal has good cheek bones. Im intrigued
Tonights a good stopping point. Tomorrow I watch the last 6 episodes of Hannibal, ie. the Red Dragon arc.
_Akbota_ : Today I want to start watching 3rd season of Hannibal download here [link removed] http://t.co/bo3LQvnIZB
I loved the Hannibal finale Saturday. It was good enough and open enough to interpretation to please all types of Fannibal. #HannibalMicDrop
The moment I truly fell in love with Will was at the beginning of Sakizuke, when he plays Hannibal for the 1st time. #Hannibal #rewatch
@PhoenixEmpathy - he crosses his legs once he was sat. Hannibal raises an eyebrow upon hearing the teasing tone of the other's voice, he -
I dream of a world where not only is Hannibal in it 4th season but we're also looking forward to a Hannibal vs Dexter Halloween special lol
Bit concerned my brother hasn't read the facebook message I sent him asking him to bring me the last 2 episodes of Hannibal tomorrow.
Gutted that Hannibal has finished,really hope someone pics it up for Fuller to do a 4th season or even a movie,sure @pashley13 would agree
@arthurrcustodio - ahhh don't talk about it!! I'll start tomorrow night at home or the day after. Need to finish Hannibal first
There's a 99% chance I'm going to start Hannibal tomorrow.
My mum just asked me what we're supposed to watch now on Thursday nights since Hannibal is over ;A;
@lilmacmillan I'll be Abigail on Saturday and Hannibal on Sunday :D If you think you see me shout loud and I'll probably hear it~
I'm so glad we're doing this. I'm so glad we're doing it on Saturday too. ha.  Hannibal isn't leaving my life nope! #Hannibal #EatingThem
I have packed just about everything needed for #Tracon starting tomorrow. I am now allowed to watch a couple episodes of Hannibal and knit.
Just sat down to watch the final episode of Hannibal, Season 3. Incredible show!
I'm so excited for the new episode of Hannibal tomorrow *cries*
@SharingTheGuilt -may try and poison me? Hmm?" Hannibal stood straight, he said that in an almost sarcastic tone but this was still a cat -
I'm going to binge watch Hannibal tomorrow night. Anyone wish to join me? @d0wninunderland @scully_snails @whatacunningboy @someotherworld
Nearing the end of Season the 1st of HANNIBAL. I love it so much already I'm devastated in advance that the show stopped before Clarice.
@eddus We've gone for Hannibal over trash but still, lazy days! Am excited to see you and catch up tomorrow. Hello to R.
@BryanFuller Just rewatching the 2nd series finale of Hannibal for the nth time. Not enough words to explain how much it all means to me!
@alfredosaucyy it was on thurs :/ it was a last minute secret show at club bahia. it was so dope! Hannibal and donnell rawlings came thru
@T4RD1S nah it was there for a few years. Breaking bad, first couple of seasons of GoT, Hannibal, mad men, 1st season of true detective, 1st
I start college tomorrow. I think today is the best day to start watching Hannibal
#Hannibal has been a brilliant series tho &amp; the fact we don't know if Hannibal is still alive leaves door open for a 4th season #Hopefully
Okay I'm going to watch Dexter and Hannibal and get high and sleep because fuck Monday.
@Illessa Based on the 1st ep, Mr Robot seems a good series to go on to.It looks to respect the audience in the same way as Hannibal, a least
While I was at Taco Bell I got to thinking about Hannibal. I might not be ready to watch the finale but MAYBE I could watch the 2nd to last.
@TheEricGoldman Seriously, when people lament they didn't take the 1st possible deal for Hannibal, I tell them go watch Lost in La Mancha.
@SkyLivingHD I'm going to be lost without Hannibal on a Wednesday
@JohnC1908 I pretty sure none of those fans regret not being there to see Harper strike out in the 9th on a pitch in the dirt.
@Lawson890 @AdamRubinESPN @msimonespn @ynscspds Goldschimdt? for leading a last place team? Harper? may not even make the playoffs lol
Harper's Worst Offense against Refugees may be Climate Record as rising temperatures add to chaos in the Middle East http://t.co/FqypEHSLKt
But hey, if you're mad at Harper, go to the game tomorrow and tell him how you feel for all 9 innings
iSIS took last oilfield Syria. Harper's 3 bombing runs  may kill civilians not the problem or cause. http://t.co/U37nfqwZ9z #cdnpoli #elxn42
@Misesforever @Liz_Cheney If u keep Harper as PM I may well cross the Lake myself! U have one incredible leader. Balanced budget and all!
If Harper doesn't want fans to leave in the 7th perhaps he and his teammates should stop under performing and losing big ball games? #nats
@newbsradio let's go easy on the pigs. I just can't stand the sight of Harper. It's the 21st century...can't we teach robots to love?
@CBCPolitics Harper the CPC are going to become a 3rd place party because of your reckless leadership #stopharper #cdnpoli #elxn42
News in the #DMV: Commuters face "Terrible Traffic Tuesday"; 6 shot, 1 fatally, in 2 DC shootings; Hot, 93; Nats lose, Harper calls out fans
@NEWS957 Harper &amp; cabal insult the intelligence of Canadians on a daily basis. Tired of all the lies &amp; spin. Roll on Oct 19th! #auditthisPOS
Of many single issue reasons to reject Harper. This is one. Imagine the cost of removing all that concrete. #elxn42  https://t.co/hTwpHozGOT
New CPC ad: Harper may not be perfect, respectful, reliable, accountable, truthful, but... wait where were we going with this?  #elxn42
@CBCNews Trudeau may do better if he attacked the NDP, no need to waste time on Harper the Media is 24/7 with the anti Harper narrative
@WrightHFX @NDP_HQ you may have principles but lack reality. Liberal far out perform Harper &amp; Mulroney's record. too bad
New election laws crreated by cpc makes it difficult to vote against Harper Even w/ 70% of voters against Harper, he may still win #fixed
so Harper is blaming Del Mar racing another meet for the summer meet's struggle.  Never change California racing.
@lynn_carleton The consortium too. I wanted Harper's hand to be forced &amp; w/ 3rd in polls, he'd have no choice. Mulcair let him off the hook.
"Harper spoke Tuesday on how the Cons will balance their security concerns with more refugees into Canada". Instigating hate #cdnpoli
Harper's NEW AD I am WHO i am not perfect but depend on me for economy  Harper slip sliding down the polls-3rd We KNOW WHO YOU ARE scares US
Anyone in Niagara tomorrow should note that Harper will be in Welland. The sulfuric smell won't be coming from the Netherby tunnel for once.
@AdamRubinESPN I'm happy to see the #Nats sat Zimmerman over Harper...Harvey owns Harper #Mets
Michael Den Tandt: Harper says he is who he is, take him or leave him. That may not be enough - http://t.co/XyLJ7qAGYV
Harper was right lol, Nats leave in the 7th
@ZuckermanCSN I hope someone asks Harper why the team bailed in the 7th inning
I hope all the fans stayed into the 9th to watch Harper go 0-5. #nats
@TedStarkey even a successful bunt puts us right they are now 1st and 2nd 1 out after the IBB to Harper. So dumb.
Harper upset with fans  http://t.co/29S9C9Suk6  When @Bharper3407 runs out every routine grounder to 2nd then he can complain about the fans
@KennyHerzog In this series the Nationals may have lost the division and Harper may have lost the MVP.
@TarekFatah Mulcair, Trudeau and May are all weaklings just like Harper. Mulcair must dubious and dangerous of bunch. Apologist for Isis.
@KoryCPC telling why you should trust Harper. Worth the 10 min. to listen. Not after eating, though.#cdnpoli http://t.co/zG540pZvIU #cdnpoli
Armed with the tools of power &amp; intimidation Harper is trying to steal our country.  On October 19th, armed with pencils LET'S TAKE IT BACK.
Harper:NDP or Liberal Govt possible Harper's spirit broken tired of so Much Hate against him of his own making Given up the ghost Peace MON

@albertarabbit journey to ISIS. Harper is a dangerous man. For all our sake I hope he goes. Ours is early Nov but I can vote during ++
I wonder if this kind of heckling will happen tomorrow when Harper holds events in #PEI? What say you, Islanders? https://t.co/NFmWtWuNJh
Does anyone know where Harper will be appearing tomorrow on #PEI?  #Charlottetown?  #Summerside? The coward is keeping it secret again.
CTV Report Harper's troubled campaign may result in the dumping of his campaign manager Jenni Byrne #cdnpoli #elxn42 https://t.co/OD1AL1dzWX
I think the #NDP may have made an error being to focussed on Harper and forgetting about Trudeau who is now leading in the polls.

@BRADSPORTS @jaketapper The news is bad for her. Ergo, it may not be presented as the most happy thing for Hillary.
Hillary is the Washington establishment, say whatever it takes to get elected. We need a change up... It may not be me but elect someone
@IbadPoulette Remember how NYT aided Bush's March to Iraq War?  They need to be truthful &amp; they haven't with Hillary.

Hillary will not make history as 1st female Pres. She'll make history by being 1st Pres candidate to be indicted on criminal charges.
@BlissTabitha So I guess dropping in on the Kardashians was just her 1st gig? The "New/Fresh" Hillary primed for reality TV Generation!
You may not have seen, but the left loves their liars, cheats &amp; traitors. Hillary is their perfect candidate! https://t.co/rP2z1upkwM

Wait. People claim Hillary is showing her humanity because she chokes up talking about her dead mother? That may be the lowest bar ever.
Hillary can take her phony apology and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. She is only sorry she was caught it's all about power.

City will come 3rd in that group. Sevilla will top it, Juventus runners up
@manneredguy @BallHogba @j85royals Like Juventus is big. But really thought one of the big 3 may have made a play with a loan
@CoolFMNigeria @manipulator77 @MercyAjisafe @AjukaRosemary Man city, the group is tricky, Juventus to top, Sevilla n city will fight for 2nd
Group D looks pretty intense with Borussia Mon, Juventus, Man City &amp; Sevilla!
No sign of Pogba in the official Juventus clubstore. (3rd kit promotion) http://t.co/uROk8jEtlb
Juventus have sign Cuadrado and presenting him like its the 2nd coming of Del Piero. Why? :O
Well Rome is rather beautiful! Can't wait to the Roma - Juventus game on Sunday! http://t.co/9OsshdZwX0
87 years of Italian Serie A history produced a first for Juventus on Sunday: they lost at home on the opening day of the season
Juventus will lose to Roma on Sunday and will lift the Scudetto come end of the season.
No Pogba can't go to Chelsea he needs to wait at Juventus when his time comes he should go to Barca or RM https://t.co/laabXokDsM

@mast84 how much more? (to be clear I hate Juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. They may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly
The club denied on Saturday that Juventus had made an offer. Heldt: Because no offer had been made at the time of the statement.
Consult a Dr. If you will watch the 2nd half of Swansea vs ManUtd over Roma vs Juventus match @ 7:00
It's Sunday and its a TOP game in the Serie A with both #Pjanic and #Dzeko starting against Juventus. I love it. http://t.co/rCQPcpvrxh
As things stand, the bottom 3 in Serie A are Bologna (18th), Empoli (19th); and Juventus (20th).
This is very bad for Juventus. Lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss Pirlo, Tevez &amp; Vidal already :(
Juventus hopeless without their 3 key players and a poor transfer window. Hope the cunts end up 5th in the league.
For the 1st time in Serie A history, Juventus has lost their opening 2 games. Roma 2-1 Juventus -Dr.Cfc-
Digne and Falque caused Juventus real problems down their left in the 1st half. #ASRoma #Juventus
Our performance was unreal today man, beating Juventus 2-1 on the 2nd game of the season is a massive motivational boost for the team.
Juventus had two men sent off as their dismal start to defending their Serie A title continued with defeat at Roma on Sunday.
I will undergo my medical for Juventus tomorrow, I can play trequartista and CAM, both at the same time.
Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is ready to snub Chelsea and wait for a mega-deal at the end of the season. (The Sun) #JUVENTUS #CFC
De Rossi believes Juventus may struggle to cope this season as he does not think they have adequately replaced Tevez, Pirlo or Vidal
Juventus has lost the first two matches of the Serie A season. Perspective: they picked up their second loss of last season on April 11

Turns out watching the Kurt Cobain doco when feeling edgy on an oppressively rainy Sunday wasn't a great choice. Someone bring kittens.
Just found my 9th grade diary. Highlights include wanting to ask God who the hell he thinks he is, and being able to relate to Kurt Cobain..
@DannyBrennan72 as long as you don't go all Kurt Cobain on me, he may have been awesome, but he might not have made the best choises lol
@itsrobotface DO NOT watch the Kurt Cobain doccie. Just don't. Self Portrait, The Cult of JG Leroy, virunga &amp; They Will Have To Kill Us 1st
this Kurt Cobain documentary broke my heart. May he rest in peace and i hope Justice honors his death. #KurtCobain #Justice #Nirvana

I hate Jon for making me watch the Kurt Cobain documentary because I'll end up listening to Nirvana all day tomorrow.
Smells Like Teen Spirit playing between the top and bottom of the 10th. Probably not what Kurt Cobain had in mind.
In the next hour, i debut my film about Kurt Cobain.  I plan on making lots of films, but i chose Kurt for the 1st.  We have a connection

In 4th year when nowt was more important than Nirvana I wrote a bit about why Kurt Cobain didn't kill himself lol http://t.co/C2ESUkIHml

Are you excited #Nirvana fans? Unreleased Kurt Cobain songs to come out in November! via @CNN http://t.co/o7b47x1yhu http://t.co/Jk3Uu5bHVz
I love REM but Sweetness Follows may be the most depressing song ever. Kurt Cobain may have even killed himself whilst listening to it ffs.
"...and the sun became as black as sackcloth. And the moon became as blood." - Kurt Cobain 1967-1993
"Now I gotta cut loose, footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes. Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees." - Kurt Cobain 1967-1993
"And I'm glad you're feeling much better. You're still very pale, though! A little sun..." - Kurt Cobain 1967-1993
I'd say I want to be like Kurt Cobain but I can't bear the thought of living till I'm 27. Blow my head off with a shotgun tomorrow.

Promotions coming out Thanksgiving &amp; Black Friday r going to triple whatever business we have now. Many will go from BP to Lexus in no time!
The thing about being older is that when I see people like Miley dressing the way she does, all I think is "Meh, Madonna did it 1st."
@Bonn1eGreer Do you not find it a little wierd that in many places where there are black Madonna's black people may experience racism.

Listening to old school Madonna before heading out for a Friday night in Brisbane with a mad Italian #cherish #Madonna
@VanSickle8GMS You can resort to the old Madonna hit "Holiday!.....Calibrate!"if need be. That may have pre-dated you, however.
So what if Madonna thought BTW was "reductive"? Is she not allowed to have an opinion or be honest?? https://t.co/kTNG9ZAams
the most important thing madonna has ever said is " don't go for 2nd best "
@THR She has the right to disagree. I hate Madonna! But don't think she should be stopped singing her shitty songs. 1st amendment, bro!
@AndThatsMadonna @tiknamonster @BloodyBurqa @AidanUnderYou Madonna's albums may flop, but she can still gross high from a tour nowadays.
@britneyspears I fell just like a lot of Madonna's old songs for real thats how I live I don't know about everybody else but yeah it may
@alauwasser If it keeps making money for HBO, they may have to start going to former colonies as well. Or even have to take Madonna.

I may not seem like the target demographic but let me tell u that I think Magic Mike XXL is one of the most excellent pieces of film making
Yes, Magic Mike XXL is a feminist movie, but the reason may surprise you http://t.co/3r5JTNDLMa
What is this force that compels me to keep watching Magic Mike XXL? Saw it the 2nd time yesterday and am already ready to see it again.
Also, ace time with the uni ladies. Saturday in Stonehaven, barbeque, Magic Mike XXL, tons of food... hips hurt from all the walking though!

I'm taking my women's networking group to see Magic Mike XXL tomorrow and many of them are over 60 so this is going to be a good time.
Who will go see Magic Mike Xxl with me before I leave on the 31st???
sister accidentally saw Magic Mike XXL with our mom &amp; wont take a break from texting how horrified she was to say how it compares to the 1st
Dear all people I know who are attracted to men:  Go see Magic Mike XXL.  Fair warning - you may fall madly in love with Matt Bomer. *swoon*
Magic Mike XXL was the perfect warm up for tomorrow night's entertainment.
@pootriarch @frolicandetour I approve (not of the rough day. May I recommend a viewing of Magic Mike XXL to cheer you up?)
I hadn't seen @bejohnce cry until today at our 5pm showing of Magic Mike XXL (was my 3rd time seeing it &amp; I would again)

I think I'll go watch Magic Mike XXL at the theatre again tomorrow. I'm in that kind of mood. I need me some male stripper action!
Magic Mike XXL may be my favorite movie of the summer. I was smiling and laughing the entire time.

I was SO disappointed with Magic Mike XXL!!! If it would have came out first, I dont think I would have watched the 2nd one.
Attention, Queens. I finally found a good copy of Magic Mike XXL so I will be watching it a 3rd and 4th time with whoever hasn't seen it yet

Mariah Carey cut a voluptuous figure when she stepped out in Sardinia on Thursday morning.
I'm not sure which is funnier - the coloured-vinyl reissue of Mariah Carey's Christmas album or the fact that it's coming out in October.
@AfroUnique and I once sat in a Walgreens parking lot attempting to sing Mariah Carey's "My All" and probably scared the neighbors
i can't wait to buy Elha's album &amp;see her shows May you continue giving justice to Mariah Carey songs. deserved to win! #TVK2Finale #lambily

Javier Saviola: "I'd be delighted if Messi won his 5th Ballon d'Or because of the quality of his football and because of our friendship."
What a great cover for the 1986 winner....I feel @francefootball need to do something very special for Messi's 5th. http://t.co/ixSDV38UhN
Hahah Lol so Halilovic was shaking when he saw Messi for the 1st time. I'ld probably faint if i ever meet him.
3-0 Lavezzi on fire w his 2nd goal. Too bad he couldn't do it in World Cup or Copa America. Crowd still chanting "Messi" #Argentina #Bolivia
Whoaaaa...! #MESSI's show is on.. MESSI with the 2nd Goal... MESSI scored a brace. The greatest ever has destroyed them. #ARGvBOL
@THEHOLYDEATH_7 tbh this game is bunk...I just wanna watch Monday's game with Messi
Messi has scored against every South American team, he is just the 4th player to achieve that. http://t.co/c73n9C3Fhn
Bullshit! That would then mean you'd piss off Messi. Then have to pay him more too.  https://t.co/MeABTj2Bvx
Tomorrow Getafe-Barcelona (Copa del Rey). Looks like Messi will start on the bench for the 3rd consecutive time
@Safeeyar yap. That's why i dont understand why they're making fun with messi's height. Do they expecting him to be a Jan Koller? Lol
Messi (back in January): 'My dream is to finish my career at Barcelona for as long as people want me'
De Biasi (coach ALB): "Ronaldo better keeps quiet tomorrow or Messi will get my vote for the Ballon d'Or this time."
Mascherano and Messi, who didn't start for ARG against BOL on Friday, are expected to start the friendly against MEX on Tuesday. [via sport]
I'm sad I can't watch Messi and the Argentina squad on Tuesday :(
Messi and Mascherano could start the Argentina game against Mexico on Tuesday in Dallas, Texas [sport]
@CulesAmericano Messi has the 6th best dribble succes rate (81%) in Europe's top 5 leagues this term of players to attempt 10+ dribbles
Messi, I'll see you tomorrow don't worry
im just excited to see messi tomorrow
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
And people still doubt @WayneRooney  absolutely comical. He may not be Ronaldo and Messi but he's our best player by a mile
Messi will now attempt to break Telmo Zarra's record on 22 November when Barcelona face Sevilla at the Camp Nou
the crowds gonna go crazy when Messi comes in for the 2nd half
If Messi gets injured tonight, Dallas won't exist tomorrow. https://t.co/9JlZf9f5Lh
Messi needs to show up more in the 2nd Half. #mexicovsargentina
12:26am and we've got US Open Drama, Colbert's debut, and Messi just scored a sick goal for Argentina.  All Live/1st run now.
And that is why messi is the best in the world. Good game though. Now to wait till October 10.
And Argentina say Messi does nothing for the national team??! That goal was just magical Messi time as usual, c'mon! XD
Very proud of that 2nd goal from Mexico! Even tho they didn't win (nothing new) props to Messi for the last min goal http://t.co/MMbK3Z706L
Luis Enrique looks set for a defeat if he calls Messi and Mascherano for training straight on Friday Just one day before the game
@Fraudiesta I agree with Messi being 3rd but my top 3 would be:  1.Hazard 2.Suarez 3.Messi
International Break Recap: Neymar, Messi, Rafinha score on Tuesday: Tuesday night was a good one for the Barcelona internationals tha...
Top 3 players in the world? Has to be: Suarez/Ronaldo/Messi.  Only reason Messi is 3rd is because he's not proven in EPL. La liga is poor
You may dislike either Messi or Ronaldo, but you can't dislike Zlatan.
