@nevona @BernieSanders I love Bernie Sanders, it's great you're spending your Saturday for his campaign.
the only thing that i am afraid of if bernie sanders is president he may die in office.
I told my dad I may vote for Bernie Sanders this election &amp; he's literally giving me the silent treatment LOL HEADASS #butthurtaf.
Bernie Sanders is like your 8th grade class president who won the election by campaigning to have 3 hour recess and free cookies every day.
@gop_reaper @ginou1010 Now, now, some of them are coming over to support Bernie Sanders, because he makes sense, but then they may agree?
Bernie Sanders joined a picket line in the sun &amp; after gave a 3hr speech. I'm significantly younger &amp; exhausted from putting groceries away.
Even Bernie Sanders thinks Cal football isn't getting enough hype. There's no reason they can't start 5-0 and finish 2nd in the Pac-12 North.
If Bernie Sanders gets elected he'll create 2nd depression by high taxes, outsource jobs,small businesses collapsing https://t.co/smtMptt8h6.
Bernie Sanders may be extreme, but he honestly seems to despise poverty, racism, discrimination, war, income inequality, &amp; corrupt politics.
@DanielWitDaPolo well you may have noticed that Bernie Sanders doesn't slander other politicians. He's never ran a negative campaign. :)
What about the other candidates?  All have a chance.  *smiling*  Bernie Sanders may upset them all.
It's bernie sanders' birthday on the 8th im excited I love him.
Bob Marley vs James Brown mashup will make anyone feel good on a Dance Party Saturday on @GTFORadioXXX Goto http://t.co/wxNtkJ4Hty.
It's #house Thursday..."when music hits u feel no pain" Hon.Bob Marley said that   have a lovely day fam.
Seeing videos of them performing at digi has made me excited to see the jacks in November.
I'm so excited for the new episode of Hannibal tomorrow *cries*.

I hate you @Adobe, u crash more then any other application Tho @Microsoft office ur close 2nd U both can share #firstplace 4 my dislike 2day.
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi.
@jmilam71591 @DCComics  I hate that they have about 3-4 active universes around. Also, having to take from batman's villain stable? C'mon.
@therealgokwan what I hate is when the sun brings out the men who think they look like David Beckham but dont..put it away!!
